Absolutely lovely food second to none in Carlow in my opinion. And served up to you by an absolute gentleman and his amazing staff (by John Dunne) [6 months ago] | Review 2: 1 star - Absolutely disgraced , food took over an hour and a half to come , was luke warm and bland. The curry sauce was a 3/10 at most and was also Luke warm.

There is a car park nearby and only 2 min walk from an electric car charging point. If I ever pass by Tullow again I would definitely visit this place. (by Panpan Lin) [7 months ago] | Review 2: 1 star - Quality of food here before new management  was of a high standard , would visit every Friday late afternoon. Was open to late now closes at 5pm as under new management. visited today for lunch  very disappointed. Chips were not the usual chippy standard and were probably re heated. Portions were less and dessert menu basic without  the usual pavlova and toffee pudding etc. The dining room had also too many flies. Apparently the chef was let go three weeks ago , he was friendly , good at his job and a great cook. Below are photos before change of management. Such a shame things have changed. (by Drew Heron) [6 years ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Called in for a late breakfast last week. Food was lovely. Service was very good.

Opens Saturday and Sunday from 12 and last orders are 730
We ordered starters and main but never received starters üò¢
Mains were OK fish was on the small side but fresh and roast was more patoto than meat....I think gravy should be put in little jug instead of all over dinner
The place itself was very busy and alot bigger inside with alot of quirky stuff around
Would I eat again I am not too sure (by Siobhan myles nolan) [a year ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - This is a great pub
We‚Äôve visited a few times recently and always found it to be very welcoming with excellent service

Would definitely return for food and drinks again. (by Maggie Murphy) [3 weeks ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - Loved the atmosphere. The decor around the pub are fascinating.

The waitress checked up on us from time to time which is great and they were very kind to us

The food has been delivered to us very quickly so I am pleased with the service

I ordered some Chicken wings and chips and loved every bit of it, however the reason why I gave it four instead of five is because Since the Chicken wings get Soaked in Barbeque sauce it gets rather messy when you pick it up and eat with your hands.
Next time please give more Napkins since it took 4 napkins (I only got 2 at the start and had to ask my friend for theirs)
for me to get the Sauce all off me.

Other than that it is a really good pub to go to and I really enjoyed it there! (by Nicole Dzhungurova (Nikol)) [2 years ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Beautiful pub.

Portions not the best. Dessert was paid for separately which I found odd. Usually about locally such as Shackletons Rest you pay for dessert along with main meal. More expensive Sunday lunch than anywhere locally. Waiter kept on getting in the way , not well organised. Better food on a night time my wife tells me.

Veg on New Year Eve left  a lot to be desired and the following evening early in the evening there was already 3 items unavailable.   I would expect someone like that late in the evening.   Also frozen chips were served not what was advertised on the Menu and when I ordered I made the point of making it clear that I wouldn't accept frozen chips but still arrived with them.   I also felt my complaint was listen to but nothing offered as compensation not even a drink but overall apart from that the rooms, staff and everything else in the hotel was good (by Maria Reid) [a year ago] | Review 4: 2 stars - Dry food, not tasty and too salty‚Ä¶.

When I politely asked about drinks, I was greeted with attitude and even shouted at across the bar‚Äîdespite the venue being almost empty.

To make matters worse, the bartender refused to deliver the drinks to our table for no clear reason. What shocked me most was the poor hygiene: I witnessed her putting straws in her mouth before placing them in drinks, all while laughing and joking with her friends behind the bar.

The entire experience felt disrespectful and careless. Definitely not what I expected from a place that presents itself with any level of hospitality.

I saw my order of chips being reheated in oil instead of being freshly made. When I asked the staff member about it, she admitted it and said she could make me a new portion if I was willing to wait. While I appreciate the offer, reheated food should never be given to customers in the first place. Really makes me question the quality and standards at this branch.

I ordered the egg Benedict with hollandaise sauce , but it wasn't hollandaise ( tasted like watered down taco sauce )and it was one slice of bread that was soggy as eggs weren't drained off.

My wife got smashed avocado, but it wasn't smashed it was sliced avocado with salad and soggy bread as the eggs weren't drained . The smashed avocado was terrible, this needs to be looked at . Both eggs were hard boiled and they need to update the menu as the food served doesn't match the description on menu  especially the hollandaise sauce served needs to be changed from hollandaise to taco sauce and smashed avocado needs to be changed to sliced avocado salad

The pasta dish and the steak were both enjoyed by our party. Italian-born staff involved and servers are very attentive. (by Jo Gar) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Given that this is a Michael-starred restaurant with so many awards, I expected better service. When we finished our meal, we had to order dessert just to have the plates cleared. Despite using our napkins and finishing our meal, the dirty napkins were not taken away by the waitstaff. My empty soda glass remained on the table until the bill arrived, and no waiter picked it up. For a place with such a prestigious reputation, I expected a higher level of service.

As for the food, it was good but not exceptional. The desserts, however, were fantastic and truly wowed us. The ambiance of the place was very nice, but it was a bit stuffy and warm inside. Improving the ventilation would be beneficial.

Restrooms are one of the most important aspects of a restaurant, and here they were very clean, just as I expected, with a fresh scent. (by Mr. Sam) [a year ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Phenomenal service & food with great value. Take all the recommendations they offer. We did 1 2-course & 1 3-course meal (known for the duck) which was perfect for a couple with a 1 glass & a bottle of wine.
There‚Äôs a reason this is a Top 10 restaurant in Ireland. Don‚Äôt miss it. (by Amy Brauner) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 2 stars - If you‚Äôre visiting from the United States, particularly if you‚Äôre accustomed to the culinary standards of cities like Miami or New York, the food here may come across as underwhelming. The dishes lack depth and complexity of flavor, leaning toward the bland and uninspired. I would recommend avoiding the steaks or any beef cuts, which were particularly disappointing.

Service also fell short of expectations ‚Äî we were left with soiled plates on our table for an extended period, and water refills had to be repeatedly requested. Overall, the experience did not meet the level of hospitality or quality one might hope for when dining out. (by Phillip Rybin) [2 months ago] | Review 10: 4 stars - Overall, we had a lovely experience here. The food is good. I get the feeling the staff/owners think it's ""high end"" - it's not.

However, their tiramasu is absolutely amazing. (by Derek Hogan) [a year ago]",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ristorante+Rinuccini/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x485d309e51632a93:0x16a042a44cb60548!8m2!3d52.650284!4d-7.250723!16s%2Fg%2F1th0m99s!19sChIJkypjUZ4wXUgRSAW2TKRCoBY

There is a small play area for young children in the restaurant part which is handy. I only gave it 3 stars because the bathroom was filthy and we had to use dish soap to wash our hands in. The floor in the bathroom had puddles everywhere and my daughter kept asking who peed on the floor. While in the restaurant part there was nothing to tackle the amount of flies and bugs. Where we were sitting there were 5 wasps and 1 bee and an uncountable amount of flies. It's a slight turn off to see that. However, over at the counter where the kitchen is was a medium blue light zapper. Is gusto is fine for take aways but the only reason I sit in is so my child can use the play area. To be honest, once the other take away re-opens I won't be going back to is gusto. (by Joanne Keena) [7 years ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Absolutely appalling customer service!!

I specifically rang the shop and asked for salt and vinegar on my meal because when I order it on just eat they ignore the comment box and always send the order up without salt and vinegar. So after I had rang the shop with my order and it got delivered the order was still wrong so I rang the shop and the man had a smart attitude over the phone and said next time he will put twice as much! Then agreed to send a fresh order down and after waiting 1.5 hours order never showed up so I had to drive to the chipper myself with my order and I was told the order wasn't put back out for delive and I was told to shut up when I was trying to speak! I have ordered here a lot and I will not be ordering again! Reheated chips, kebab trays and garlic chips+cheese trays are gone half the size to what they used to be and still full price!

As it is located very town centre do great to get to places but also right beside a pub..... it's very loud.... and the people don't care as they stop and talk and argue right at your window..... the windows have to be open as its so incredibly hot...... so no sleep at all..... also other people staying here leave the doors to shut themselves and trust me they slam!

I then went back in alone to try and talk to him and he said multiple times ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not blaming you, I‚Äôm not blaming you‚Äù insinuating that he was blaming one of the two men rather than the woman. In my opinion I think that is very sexist. One he was incorrect and two he repeated sexist remarks. Yes it is not a huge deal but all we wanted was to play a few games of pool as it is difficult to find a pub with a pool table locally. I understand he has a right to remove us if that‚Äôs what he believes but he had no interest in investigating further. He could have came around the side of the bar and quickly realized it was not us or even checked the cameras as we were accused of smoking there and then.

Very calm on a thursday night. (by Fran√ßois Hamon) | Review 5: None - Today I went in to ewings with my girlfriend and my brother, when we went in the bartender mentioned there was a smell of weed from outside , he automatically assumed it was us when we came in , he was very ignorant about it when we said to him we can prove it wasn‚Äôt us he didn‚Äôt want to hear about it, I would‚Äôve loved to show him  how we were innocent but he decided to make a show of us infront of all other customers when we did not do a thing wrong. He was also quick to assume it was the men smoking instead of the woman. We got kicked out for absolutely no reason at all and judged and embarrassed. Don‚Äôt recommend this pub to anyone because if there is a smell outside you will automatically be accused.

No breakfast. Earliest check in time is 4pm. Check out time is 11.30am. The payment is taken a week before your due to stay. The room was a standard double room. With a walk in shower / wet room. It was nice and clean and the bed was a double bed. The tv has channels from Ratuken on it. The location is across from a cathedral which chimes at 12 noon. Down stairs the bar is a fine bar with ok plenty of space and it is modern and clean.

Check out is done by depositing the key into a box on the wall just inside the main door. The lock is activated automatically and you need to hold a keyfob to unlock.

It‚Äôs a bit pricey for a bed and no breakfast. But it is what it is.

Chose the beef and its was a good choice. There was plenty of free water / cordial available. Meat was tasty and well done. Veggies were ok, they should try cooking them in stock to add some taste. Could had done with an extra spoon of gravy on it. Friendly staff, clean location.

As it was a Sunday evening, it was very quiet. I ordered my food, vegetable samosas, chicken madras, rice and naan. The starter arrived within minutes, swiftly by the main course. Nice food, reasonably priced. The negatives, it felt rushed I was in, fed and out within 35 minutes of arriving and the base sauce in the curry was a little watery. (by Andy Topham) [2 years ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Loved this place! My wife & I were staying in Carlow. My wife loves Indian food, but finds it difficult to find a really spicy curry.

The flavours and the aromas  are the real deal at Curry House. The owner and manager is very helpful and friendly. He will help you find the flavour you are looking for. This is not the usual restaurant. They only use first class ingredients. I wish you all a lot of luck and continual success. (by Machine Learning IRE) [9 months ago] | Review 4: 3 stars - Good food only issue was temperature of good, starters were cold. (by Drew Heron) [7 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - It was good food, I liked the rice a lot personally and the naan bread, tho I would have liked more salt on both. I am not a big fan of the cashew/peanut taste and therefore it gets a 4 and not a 5. The chips we got were very good and the best part, in my opinion. Good portions, tho a bit much sauce. The food was done in 15 min or less and they gave us a plastic bag over the paper one because it was raining, really appreciate that one. The man at the desk was nice and made sure we got what we wanted. I understand why people like it even tho it's not completely my style. (I had butter chicken, looking past the nuts it had good taste, the flavour of nuts was just a bit too overpowering for me.) We had food for two for around 28 euro, which is a good price.

All in all good food, pretty cheap, nice people and fast service. (by Kari Sandburg) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 1 star - Very disappointed, order quite regularly and have had no issues. This time used their website/app and paid by card. After about 10 mins I contacted the restaurant to advise that my order wasn't confirmed but I was charged and the person on the phone advised they would look into it and contact me back. I received no call/update and after a hour I still had no food. I tried numourous times to call them and eventually got through only to be told that they aren't accepting online orders today (surely this was known the first time I called but even still the website ordeing service should be temporarily shut down in cases like this). The staff member was incredibly unsympathetic and rude. I'm out of pocket now, never received any food and have to wait to see if the payment was processed on their side and follow up with them before I can get any refund, needless to say I won't order from them again.

Great service (by Romulo Romulando) [a year ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Very disappointed in the service and food we received today. Upon arrival the person who greeted us was very Stand offish, not very helpful and quite rude. We were told it was unlimited naan bread and chips with the buffet price we were paying, which was not the case. They never asked us if we were okay for everything when we could see they were asking other customers if they needed anything else, which we then found out they were regular customers, which would not make new clientele return as it was as if our custom was not good enough, other people given a jug of water on arrival, we never received any despite asking twice for it, the selection of food on the buffet was nothing short of laughable. The food itself was below average, no flavour whatsoever . We were also quiet nervous about going for extra food as there was signs all around the buffet insinuating that if there is food left on our plate that we would be charged extra for, also on their website they advertise the buffet at ‚Ç¨15 a head per adult, when we went in it was more expensive then initially advertised as, would not recommend, will not be returning. Rang to express our dissatisfaction and the worker was the rudest man I have ever spoken to in a customer service job, he hung up the phone twice, unless you are looking to have a an upset stomach, are willing to stay close to a toilet seat all evening and leaving with an empty wallet stay away at all costs.

Unfortunately the managing Director Ronnie Carroll is nothing but a bully especially when he knows if your a single mother, he is not considerite if a payment is a few days late at all and sent me 4 messages in one day while I was in work, I agreed to make sure payment was made that night only a week late and 2 days later instead of checking his bank account he sent threatening messages about my child's placement. He then received the payment of the whole month of March on that same day, conveniently, cancelled the place and refused to refund me the further 9 days I had prepaid. He is money hungry and the welfare of the kids isn't his main priority but your money is all he wants. Twice they forgot to collect my son from school. Some of the staff shouldn't be working with kids they don't have the skillset for the age ranges. They cancelled the swimming lessons in the pandemic and never returned them but the fee never decreased.

We shared a very palatable red wine from Puglia. Sadly, we had no space to test the restaurant's tiramisu but that's what I would have chosen.

My wife, who is a pizza-lover and profoundly particular, said that this is one of the best pizzas that she has ever had.  Pizza was the perfect balance of thin crust & artisanal with the ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô amount of cheese & savory sauce.

Overall, strongly suggest this place for a celebration with the vegetarian in your life. (by Mason Marks) [4 weeks ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - I was happy to secure a table for 6pm on a Saturday night on the June bank holiday weekend and we were pleased that there was a 3 course weekend set menu on for ‚Ç¨33 per person. It was our first time here and we found staff pleasant and efficient without rushing you.
To start, we picked a satisfying bottle of Sangiovese di Puglia at ‚Ç¨32.
My husband opted for the Garlic bread with cheese and nduja with a smidgin of fresh salad leaves perfectly dressed. I got a few tasty morsels of this and was highly impressed and regretted my choice of the smoked trout millefoglie with carasau bread and stracciatella cheese even though it was very tasty indeed.
For mains, though I was tempted with the catch of the day oven baked cod, we both thought pasta the best bet in an Italian and we were not disappointed. I had the pasta with prawns and my husband had the chicken and chorizo pasta. The pasta brought me back to our meals in Italy and was as authentic as I have had.
To finish I had the Baileys tiramisu. It was so light and delicious but to be honest I didn't get a hint of Baileys in it. My husband chose the Crunchie cheesecake with crunchie icecream which was creamy, dreamy, flavourful and decadent.
This Italian has the portions and pacing of the meal down to a fine art in that by mains we thought we had space for dessert and by the end of dessert, we were at capacity.
We both would highly recommend for quality of food, value and atmosphere and hope to return in the future once a babysitter is lined up. Grazie. (by Emily O'Connor) [a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Make sure you make a reservation. Food was phenomenal. Had the chicken pesto pizza and a Spicy pizza. We also had the garlic cheese Chiabatta with the Nduja and it was amazing. Friends had the Bolognese and pasta. The service was really great and friendly. I would definitely recommend and return next time I'm in the area. (by David Truex) [2 years ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Had to book for dinner arrived in time and had a table already set.

I thought it was a very sneaky add on. It would have been 3 separate tables when booking had this been pointed out... I don't see how this applies  when the same amount  of people are being served whether it be 1 or 3 tables.. we would have been leaving the same amount in a tip but not any more when dining there.. it nice to leave it of your own free will rather than being compelled to do so..  Just to be aware of this for a large family when booking your table... (by Gretta Murphy) [6 months ago] | Review 5: 1 star - Eaten here a couple of times and it‚Äôs been alright.

Zuni Restaurant,Carlow,"26 Patrick St, Gardens, Kilkenny, R95 A897, Ireland",Modern European restaurant,4.7,,,,,"Review 1: 3 stars - We were really looking to our dinner at Zuni. The atmosphere was very nice even though it was not full.

Sadly the food was not great. The trout appetizer was good. The cod was overwhelmed by the edamame and mushy peas. The biggest letdown was the steak. I asked for medium rare they came back rare so I had them taken back to the kitchen to cook a little bit longer when I came back if it was still rare, but I did not want to bother them again to reheat it to the right temperature because my mashed potatoes were getting cold.  Honestly, they should‚Äôve taken the potatoes back when I sent the steak. Also when the waiter came back, he should‚Äôve checked in to see if the steak was properly cooked. He didn‚Äôt wait until the very end when there were several large pieces on the plate that were unedible. When he finally asked us how it was we told him that the steak was not properly cooked. He just said he was sorry.

A meat thermometer could have properly solved the problem. Also when a customer has an unsatisfactory meal it could either be taken off the bill or be offered a complimentary dessert. (by Virginia Huffman) [a week ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - We were very satisfied with the dinner experience here. Food was impeccable, we loved the slow cooked beef, pork belly and especially enjoyed the appetizer rabbit terrine with lentils. The desert was interesting and the presentation was fun to watch, watching the hot caramel sauce poured over chocolate covered banana ice cream ball on a chocolate sponge cake.
The waitress was very sweet and attentive. (by Yongmei Zhang) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Locals and forums recommended this restaurant. I am so happy we listened.
The presentation of the dishes, the hospitality, it was all stellar. Jess was warm, welcoming, and very attentive.

(by Phong Luu) [a week ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Make a reservation, you won't regret it.

I ordered pork belly as a starter. I was extremely hesitant about the banana chutney, but with the glazed pork belly it was well balanced and delicious. It works. Also the pork belly melted, it was so tender.

The strip loin was cooked exactly how I wanted it. Medium rare. The onion hash brown had a great crisp on the outside and complimented every bite with the steak. I treated the croquette as a little bonus with the carrot puree. The edge of the strip loin (3 bites) was a little more medium and dryer, but you wouldn't notice it with a little sweep of the bone marrow jus.

I'd be remiss to not mention the Strawberry Smash cocktail. I thought it was very nice and smooth. I had ordered an old fashion afterwards and even that was executed correctly with the orange rub along the rim.

I think for a starter, main, and two cocktails it was priced pretty reasonable for this level of quality.

I only had one night here, but I would return on a future visit.

The service was very attentive and they made multiple touch points throughout the dinner. (by Eric) [11 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - We went to this restaurant that a friend suggested and it quickly became our favorite!

Woodford Dolmen Hotel,Carlow,,,4.4,,,,,"Review 1: None - We had the joy of celebrating both our traditional wedding and our civil ceremony at the Woodford Dolmen Hotel, and it truly exceeded all our expectations. The grounds are stunning and made for the most beautiful backdrop to our photos, but what really made our experience unforgettable was the incredible team.

From the very beginning, Lucia, Clare, and Aisling supported us with warmth and professionalism, making sure every detail was covered. Shannon and Matthew were so patient and helpful in dealing with room bookings, changes, and last-minute adjustments, which gave us so much peace of mind.

The food was delicious, the service was flawless, and the overall atmosphere was filled with genuine care and attention. Our wedding days felt effortless thanks to the dedication of everyone at the Woodford Dolmen.

Matt The Millers Bar & Restaurant,Carlow,"1 John Street Lower, Gardens, Kilkenny, R95 PY7D, Ireland",Gastropub,4.5,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 5 stars - I had a good experience at Matt The Millers Bar & Restaurant. The chicken wings were very nice and definitely a highlight. The fish could have been seasoned a bit more to bring out the flavor, and the bun of the burger was on the harder side. Drinks and service, however, were excellent ‚Äì very friendly and quick. Overall, a nice spot with great atmosphere, just a few small improvements on the food side would make it even better. (by Eduard) [2 weeks ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Visiting from out of town, California specifically, and stopped by here for dinner on a Thursday night. The service was great! Everyone was so nice and attentive. The live music was awesome! Comfortable chairs and tables. The food was so yummy! I got the ribs plate and my husband got the main chicken dish with the mustard based sauce. Everything was so amazing and I highly recommend! (by Ambrosia Solis) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - The crispy Brie was definitely delicious. We also had the seafood chowder and were in heaven with that dish.  The ladies had veggie soup and I heard no complaints.  Nice atmosphere and a very beautiful server. I would return to this establishment anytime. I‚Äôm from California and was impressed with everything (by Timo) [3 weeks ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - This pub is a fantastic spot for anyone who loves live music, great food, and a solid drink menu. The atmosphere is warm and lively, with talented local musicians playing most nights. The wings are top-notch ‚Äî crispy, saucy, and full of flavor. Their fish and chips are equally impressive, with perfectly battered fish and golden fries. There‚Äôs a great mix of local craft beers and popular picks on tap. The cocktails are surprisingly good too ‚Äî creative and well-made. Service is friendly and fast, even when it‚Äôs busy. It‚Äôs the kind of place where you can settle in for the night. Whether you're out with friends or just want a good pint and live tunes, this pub delivers. A true hidden gem worth revisiting. (by Tara Elizabeth) [3 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Lovely Irish pub with live music every evening. I really enjoyed the Irish music. The food was tasty, I got the Medieval Guinness Stew and my husband got fish and chips. We share the brownie with ice cream for dessert. Service is friendly and the food came out pretty quickly. The interior is wood and stone.

(by Rob Stirling) [3 weeks ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Just want to give a massive shout-out to Jennifer at Matt the Miller‚Äôs for being so incredibly sound. We‚Äôve been looking for somewhere to host a small, casual wedding party in Kilkenny and after traipsing around to many establishments that weren‚Äôt quite right, we finally found Jennifer at Matt's. She couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful or generous with her time and expertise. Jennifer showed us all the available options for what Matt‚Äôs could offer, made suggestions for how the day could run, talked us through menu options, and was just generally very informative without being pushy. She also then followed up with an email which outlined all that we‚Äôd discussed so that we had a reference for all the details. She‚Äôs been fantastic to respond to all questions via email, and I just couldn‚Äôt recommend her enough to anyone looking for a venue hire in Kilkenny. Matt‚Äôs is an altogether great pub, with good food, friendly service, and excellent live music. Highly recommend checking this place out, particularly on a Monday evening.

Mimosa Bar de Tapas,Carlow,"College St, Carlow, Ireland",Tapas restaurant,4.7,,,,‚Ç¨30‚Äì40,"Review 1: 3 stars - A truly lovely place,the lighting is soft and cozy, creating a warm and snug atmosphere. The food is nice, portions are good, and the prices are reasonable.

However, the service was very very slow, and some of the staff came across as a bit off-putting. I waited 20 minutes after receiving my food before asking a server about my partner‚Äôs food,he said he‚Äôd check and come back, but never did. We had to ask someone else in the end.

Overall, the food and setting were great, but the service definitely needs improvement.

Mimosa is hands down one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm, welcoming, and beautifully designed. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive without being overbearing.

The food? Absolutely phenomenal. Every dish we ordered was flavorful, fresh, and presented with care. You can tell there's a lot of thought put into the menu.

Drinks were also on point, and the dessert selection was the perfect way to finish off the meal.

I live locally and would love to be a frequent customer but this really turns me off.
My husband and I decided to give you another try this morning. When he asked could he have the bacon,on the breakfast stack unchopped,the waitress explained,that's the way it comes. She did suggest he could skip the bacon and replace it with an extra sausage only to discover, when our plates did arrive, that EVERYTHING was chopped. I am sorry,this just gives off the wrong vibe.
I would love to know why any cafe thinks this is a good idea?
You have a lovely space the food is disappointing. (by GRACE BILL) [3 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - I felt like I stepped into a  movie caf√©.

However, the dinner was very disappointing.
- very few fish options in the menu. Mostly meat.
- i ask to the waitress not to add sauce to my sea-bass if the sauce contained lactose because I‚Äôm lactose intolerant and next I get a plate with potatoes and a bunch of cheese and cream on top.

All if it was delicious and I would definitely get it all again.

One thing thats worth sharing as well, I thought I got the wrong meal (hot garlic chicken) as it was sweet and had a brown sauce, which is different than I've had before in other Chinese takeaways.  So I called just to let them know I got the wrong order.  The girl who answered was lovely, apologetic and polite, which is tough in an awkward situation when working in customer service.  Then the manager came onto the phone to give a refund, she was also super friendly and apologetic.  It actually turned out that their version of hot garlic is sweet, so I said I'd give it a go and did not take the refund.  It was delicious and I'd buy it again, so I was happy!

Overall, the food was delicious and hot, and the staff were lovely!  üôÇ (by Lisa Finegan) [2 years ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Ribs were just pure fat and bones. Every cause was stinking of vinegar.

(by Mary Redmond) [Edited a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - When I first turned to Apache Carlow, I was looking for something different, something that could help me build the unique family I always dreamed of. Little did I know, this would lead to a whirlwind adventure of both fatherhood and love‚Äî50 times over!

Apache Carlow was nothing short of a miracle. Through their innovative approach to... well, life in general, I was blessed with the ability to bring 50 wonderful children into this world. Each birth was handled with the utmost care and precision, making sure both my kids and their mothers were in safe hands. I still remember the joy of watching each new addition to my family and knowing that Apache Carlow played an instrumental role in making it all happen.

But that's not all‚ÄîApache Carlow had some unexpected bonuses along the way. As I worked my way through their life-altering services, I found myself meeting incredible women who shared my vision for a big, happy family. Through fate (and maybe a little help from the universe), I met 50 amazing women who I‚Äôm lucky enough to call my wives today.

There was something magical about how everything came together‚ÄîApache Carlow didn't just help me start a family; it helped me build a community, a support network, and a truly one-of-a-kind household. The sense of unity, love, and teamwork that we all share is something that I never could have achieved on my own.

If you're looking for a way to multiply your family in the most surprising and life-affirming way, look no further than Apache Carlow. It‚Äôs not just a service‚Äîit‚Äôs a life-changing journey that led me to my 50 beautiful children and 50 incredible wives. I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful!

You need to look at your staff and either give them better training with dealing with customers and learn to  take responsibility for their actions instead of denying the allocation while there was proof shown that they had taken money from her account. Dreadfully service. (by Rosemary McDermott) [a year ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - My recent experience ordering from Apache Pizza Carlow for delivery left me utterly impressed and fully satisfied. As a connoisseur of pizza, I can confidently say that it was the best I've had in quite some time.

From the moment the delivery arrived, I could tell it was going to be a memorable culinary experience. The aroma wafting from the box hinted at the deliciousness within, and I eagerly took my first bite. (by Wesley Renes) [a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - 10/10 takeaway

Rive Gauche Kilkenny,Carlow,"2 The Parade, Gardens, Kilkenny, Ireland",Irish restaurant,4.6,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - I looooved this restaurant a lot. Wasn't expecting to find a jewel in Kilkenny from the get go. It was a random choice and such a lucky one. The food was a delight. Not only tasty, but artistically arranged. The staff is helpful, attentive and at the same time not distracting you from enjoying the food - nice balance here. And atmosphere is a separate joy. If I could, I would have given 6 starsüòÅ. Fancy, darkish, stylish, tasteful.
Pricing a bit on a high-medium side (about 50‚Ç¨ per person), but you expect that from a good restaurant.
Lovely evening in a lovely place. And a definite recommendation for those, who visit Kilkenny.

The decor makes me feel like I am in Paris but it‚Äôs the fabulous service that keeps us coming back time and time again. Everyone there is so attentive, friendly and professional. Tvrtko (hoping I spelled this correctly) in particular is a gentleman and looks after us so well every time we are there. Highly recommend.

If you‚Äôve ever wondered what it‚Äôs like to pay good money for a plate of regret, look no further.

As someone who‚Äôs dairy intolerant, I came prepared to make a simple request: vegan cheese. The waitress, clearly thrilled to be there, reluctantly checked with a colleague before returning with the shocking revelation that they didn‚Äôt have any. Fine. I then asked whether the mozzarella was from buffalo or cow‚Äôs milk ‚Äî a question apparently so outrageous it was met with an abrupt ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù  So, I ordered the pizza without cheese, bracing myself for something plain but edible. What arrived was‚Ä¶ art. Not the good kind ‚Äî more like a modern installation titled ""Why Did I Bother?""
The mushrooms? Bland, rubbery slithers that could easily be mistaken for strips of boiled fat.
Save yourself the trouble ‚Äî and your stomach ‚Äî and eat literally anywhere else.

Small tubs are no good! Maybe up the price a small bit and do bigger portions of sauce. (by Al M) [10 months ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - Been ordering from Kung Fu for years but last night I was so disappointed with my food. Ordered a satay noodle box with king prawn but the sauce was extremely watery and tasteless. Normally it‚Äôs thick with chunks of peanuts throughout but this sauce was almost like a strange broth at the bottom of my noodle box, with almost no flavour to it at all. Vegetables also tasted a little off, they didn‚Äôt seem fresh, broccoli was very mushy. Also ordered a portion of chicken balls with sweet and sour sauce but was disappointed with the size of them, they were more like chicken nuggets and were sopping with grease. The sweet and sour sauce also had a strange jelly like consistency, which was quite off putting. I‚Äôm not sure I would order from here again, quite sad as normally this is my to-go spot for a Chinese, sorry. (by Erin Flood) [9 months ago] | Review 4: 1 star - I am absolutely disgusted,
I wasn't even In the door and I felt unsafe and as a young girl that is no good, had to ask my dad to come in with me!! The vibe was horrible, we used to eat here all the time before we found a better place but it was closed today so we went here. I ordered a spicebag, spring rolls and satay sauce and let me tell you I won't be ordering it again!! Let me start with the spring rolls,There was so little in the bag and they definitely where not fresh nor where they a good size. Onto the sauce, for a peanut sauce it had no peanut esscenes in it. Not even a hint of it, and such a small container it was gone before I even finished half the bag. Lastly I'd like to talk about the spice bag. Used to get it here all the time and the portions used to be huge and it was so delicious however. Times have clearly changed! The chicken was stringy and dry, the batter for the chicken had a weird after taste of achohol and the seasoning was definitely not a saving grace for this meal. The chips where soggy and had the same woeful seasoning as the chicken and the vegetables (or lack there of) was appalling. I understand some people don't like the veg as much as the chicken and chips but onions and decently sized carrots are a must in a good spice bag. I have to say that I won't won't going here again nor will mu family and friends, I leave this review sad, slightly scared and feeling ill from the food.

Low score is for ordering and paying online, which includes the delivery cost and a service charge. Fine. But then delivery driver wants to extort a further charge for delivery, when you've already paid!? What is this about? Do the owners know about this or just not care, or not pay the drivers enough that they have to cream off the customer. Total paid when ordering should be it. (by Travel Bug) [Edited 3 years ago] | Review 7: 1 star - We use the app to order our food.  The food has been excellent 5 out of 6 visits.  Waiting times have turned to the ridiculous,  app says the order will be ready at a particular time and it is still not ready more than half an hour later. On two out of six orders a wrong sauce has been given, by the time I drive back to get the correct sauce the food is cold. A regular customer not returning.

Its a euro i have no problem with that, my problem is the fact your establishment thinks its perfectly acceptable to over charge people, that's one person, if you do 20 deliveries in the one night that's 20 extra in your pockets for FALSE ADVERTISMENT AND OVER PRICING.

If you are going to the trouble of creating a tapas style restaurant why would you subject your patrons to a local radio station playing in the background which is mostly ads. It takes away from the food and visual experience. Otherwise very enjoyable. (by Brian F Kennedy) [3 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Nice place to eat. Great selection of tapas.

(by Jack K) [2 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Everything was absolutely excellent, it was our second time here and we can‚Äôt wait for our next visit already. Each dish was so full of flavour and freshness, the extra detail to garnish the dishes were well constructed to complement each dish. The chowder was one of the best chowders we all have ever had in Ireland. The cheesecake was also light and delicious. We all really enjoyed the Portuguese win, especially our two Portuguese friends. Would definitely recommend dining here along with excellent food and drinks, the atmosphere and service were perfect. (by Niamh Mc) [3 years ago] | Review 9: 1 star - We came here on Sunday for the first time at 8:05pm and were waiting for a table but another staff came up and told up that the restaurant will be closed in 15 minutes. However, other staff & Google say that the closing time will be at 9pm but that staff definitely confirm the whole restaurant will be closed in 15 mins and showed a very bad, unacceptable attitude towards us by making noise while polishing folks and knife. Well we were so pissed off and left the place.
But we still give Pimento another chance to fix it because we think quality of the food must be considered as well.
I visited here the second time on Monday, the food were served very quick but I thought that tapas must be served one by one? The food gone cold very quick and most of the food were very salty.
The place has nice decorations and location but need improve in services. (by May) [Edited 2 years ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Simply amazing! Delicious food, great atmosphere, and friendly service.

If you're anywhere near Leighlinbridge, do yourself a favour and stop into Rachel‚Äôs Garden Caf√© at the Arboretum ‚Äî it‚Äôs an absolute gem. The coffee is top-notch, the staff are warm, friendly, and genuinely a pleasure to deal with, and the whole atmosphere is just pure calm.

What really sets this place apart is the location. Surrounded by the beautifully maintained Arboretum gardens, you can sip your coffee while sitting in the sun, tucked into one of the many peaceful spots that make this place feel like a retreat from the world. It‚Äôs the perfect balance of a quality caf√© and a stunning garden experience.

An outstanding spot for a coffee, a stroll, and a bit of serenity. Highly recommended. (by Kildare Content Creator) [4 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Amazing oasis of calm and practicality in a lovely area just off the motorway.
Well worth a visit for all your gardening and homeware needs. Kitchenware, snazzy house things, gardening, BBQ and pets. Everything you need all served up in a bright, modern country style shopping experience.
Edinburgh knit wear shop with great value on clothing.
There is also a spacious food court with good quality food and drink. Coffee is very nice.
Outside there is a seating area in a sun room and also an inspirational garden.
For the kids there is a great playground and a genuine maze.
The toilets and spacious and clean with THE most amazing urinals I have ever seen. Ladies, stick your heads into the gents for a gawk!

A* (by Donna) [3 days ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - We went for lunch on a weekend in May, and it was an excellent choice! We were three couples and a teenager. Each couple ordered a full barbecue platter ‚Äî and there was enough food to feed an army! The portions were extremely generous, and we even had to ask for takeaway boxes for the leftovers.

The ribs were absolutely divine ‚Äî fall-off-the-bone tender! The vegetables were grilled over the same fire as the meat, giving them a smoky, meaty flavor ‚Äî just perfect.

I mentioned to the waitress that it was my husband‚Äôs birthday, and she brought out a slice of cheesecake with a lit candle. We sang happy birthday, and it turned into such a fun moment!

Also worth mentioning: a restaurant with Brazilian staff never disappoints! Our Brazilian waitress was amazing ‚Äî super friendly and attentive.

(by Christina Ripley) [a month ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - We recently visited Churrascaria o Galo, a Portuguese restaurant in Carlow. The staff were very polite, and the service was excellent.

We ordered the classic burger and a crazy beef side. The portion size was huge ‚Äì with the crazy beef side alone, there‚Äôs really no need for a starter or main course. Great value if you‚Äôre hungry!

The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, and the decor had a nice Portuguese touch, which added to the charm. It‚Äôs also a kid-friendly place ‚Äì they even offer painting activities for children, which is a thoughtful bonus for families.

That said, the food itself didn‚Äôt feel very Portuguese. More traditional Portuguese dishes or flavors would help match the theme better.

Also, a small thing to note ‚Äì they charge ‚Ç¨2 extra for mayonnaise with the burger. Usually, one dip is included without an extra fee.

I ordereda footlong with chicken bites, the food was 1 hour late and the driver was clearly lost. When I rang first to see where my food was I was told it just left the shop and be 2 minites, when I rang a half an hour later I was told it just left the shop and they were waiting for the bread to cook, he didnt remember I already rang. 1 hour late and the food comes, freezing cold chicken bites that have gone wet and soggy and also damp wet cooking from being in the bag with the hot sub and chicken that had gone cold. This would of had to be on the bag a long time for this to happen and when I rang about the issue the guy who wouldnt give me his name told me to ring just eat if i didnt like the food. He said we are busy and can not help you. I only asked for the food to be taking back and a new order made and he refused and hung up the phone.

La Boheme,Carlow,"1 Brown St, Carlow, R93 HD93, Ireland",Bar,4.3,,+353 59 916 4832,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - We ate here on Saturday night. I was expecting the food to be good, but not *this* good.

The rack of ribs were perfect : juicy and full of flavoursome meat, and marinated in a beautiful stick sauce, they were delicious.

The wings were crispy on the outside and beautifully moist in the middle. I'm not normally a wings fan, but these have converted me.

We also had the pork sliders and the burger. Both were of a standard that was really good. Both were full of flavour and very moreish, but by now we were stuffed and happy. We will have to leave more room next time to really appreciate them. (by Richard Kavanagh) [2 years ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Been here twice. Lovely atmosphere and decor. Food is nice. But one complaint I've had the twice I've gone,Once the food arrives its like your forgotten about. No one comes to see if you want another drink, I've had to go to the bar to get served and the same when you want to pay the bill and that's happened in both occasions. Think the place has great potential but customer service needs attention to detail.

(by Regina Fitzgerald) [6 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Menu for food and drink was extensive, without being confusing. Food and service was excellent. Patatas Bravas and Beef Sliders in particular are TO DIE FOR.

If you have mobility issues, specify you need seating in the front bar as most of the seating in the place is via a maze of stairs. . It was very crowded, tables a little too close together.

Staff are competent, helpful, polite, no request was too much trouble. If I lived closer I'd be broke from constantly eating there! (by Jenny Hanlon) [3 years ago] | Review 7: 1 star - Very disappointing,  the bar is lovely, nice atmosphere  and the lady at the front of house was pleasant . Menu was not great, not much choice. Lacked imagination.   The portions were smaller than the average portions. It has alot of potential with the right staff, including the kitchen which was very very poor on the delivery of meals. One of the waiters was extremely unprofessional and was very abrupt and flippant in his reply to our query. Then when the bill arrived we were charged for something we didn't receive in our order.  After dealing with the waiter, I just couldn't wait to get out. We  won't be returning. (by Bernadette Denton Daly) [3 years ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Had a great night here.

I kept wondering why they were not mentioning the cold and at least apologising for the heating, which must be broken, surely!? No, it was not broken they just held off until about 8.30pm to switch on heating. There was an older group of 4 with heavy coats on during their meal and they looked miserable. Just 10 minutes before they left the heating came on. Just outrageous. Took 45 mins to get basic starter, and an hour and half to get main our course. Place wasn't even half full. I got a vegetarian starter which I'm pretty sure had a fish sauce in it. Main meal was cold. I'm just sorry I didn't leave when I got there.

Ar√°n Artisan Bakery & Bistro,Carlow,"8 Barrack St, Pennefatherslot, Kilkenny, R95 YF30, Ireland",Bistro,4.7,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 5 stars - We heard about this place from a local so were excited to try it during our brief stay in Kilkenny. I'm so glad we stopped in because man is it delicious! We had a short wait for our table, so I'd recommend making a reservation if possible. I opted to get the seasonal Ube French Toast and my date got the Breakfast Sambo. I was blown away by how good the French toast was and my date and I swapped plates for a bit so I also got to try the Sambo and it was also fantastic. I highly recommend the Sambo if you're in a savory mood and the French toast for a sweeter palate. The service was very friendly and the vibe is great, being surrounded by local chatter during your meal. Definitely a must-visit if you're in Kilkenny looking for a local favorite. (by Geoffrey Holtsclaw) [5 days ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Just wow. Incredible breakfast place, so tasty, great service and very friendly staff. We came here after getting some recommendations from friends and seeing reviews online and were definitely not excited.
We entered and were greeted by a member of staff to be told to take a seat while waiting for a table to become available. To avoid hanger, I quickly nipped over to the sister bakery across the road to get a pastry while we waited. My husband had been seated in the meantime and we ordered the Ube Pancakes and the Breakfast Sandwich. Both were incredibly flavoursome and would highly recommend this place to others. I enjoyed the fact that the menu changes every 8 weeks so that on our next visit we might have a completely different experience.
While paying I asked the server if she wouldn't mind filling our water bottle as it was the hottest day of the year outside and she obliged (ice and all!). Highly recommend this place and already can't wait to visit again. (by Emer Kelly) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Thank you so much for the amazing food we had today.

(by Estera O) [3 days ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - We had the most amazing lunch at Ar√°n today. The menu has plenty of offer and something for everyone. I went for the Buddha bowl which was 10/10 - everything was fresh and well thought out. I also sampled a little of the toasted special and it was delicious. So rare to talk about the bread being the best part of a sandwich because its so often overlooked but this bread was delicious.

So much so we went over the road to the bakery for a sourdough loaf to bring home. We also got some hot-cross buns and some cakes. The cakes were a real disappointment though as the carrot cake is either undercooked or looked like it had been previously frozen - either way it was stodgy and inedible. We only noticed when we got home so unfortunately it went into the bin.

Highly recommend the lunch but have a second look at the cakes before leaving. (by Ciaran McPhillips) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - The perfect brunch spot, especially if you're coeliac!

From start to finish, Ar√°n was exactly what we needed on a bank holiday morning. We walked in and got a table straight away (such a win on a busy weekend), and the interior was so thoughtfully designed, everything from the layout to the little details felt aligned with the food and vibe.

One thing I really appreciated was how dog-friendly it is, even though we didn‚Äôt have ours with us. There‚Äôs a dedicated dog area, such a lovely touch!

The brunch menu had a great selection, and I nervously asked about the Ube French Toast, knowing I‚Äôm coeliac. I‚Äôve never had French toast at a caf√© before because places either can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt make it gluten free‚Ä¶ but the blonde server we had (I didn‚Äôt catch her name!) was so kind and understanding. We had a great chat about coeliac options as her sister is also gluten free, and she happily asked the chef for me. To my complete shock and delight, they made it gluten free with zero fuss.

And wow‚Ä¶ it was unreal. Ube cream cheese, syrup, strawberry compote, pistachios, it was so good it felt emotional! I felt like a kid on Christmas morning.

My boyfriend Joe got the breakfast sambo (which looked amazing) and we both had coffees too, you could tell even the drinks were made with intention. Everything felt curated to set you up for a great day.

This was my first time in Ar√°n but definitely not my last. Hands down the best brunch spot in Kilkenny. I don‚Äôt even need to check anywhere else! ü•∞‚ú® (by Susan Boyce) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Great restaurant/caf√© with very friendly waitresses & waiters.

Best meal I've had in ages. Every dish was perfectly balanced flavour, portion size and presentation.

You could not fault it in any way.

Interesting rooms with perfect little details. Alcoves in bathrooms with candles. Glass bricks in walls near ceiling for light. Huge nook full of chopped wood on either side of wood burning stove. Comfy waiting sitting room with blazing warm fire  welcoming you in on a chilly night. Lots of little details that add up to careful thought and hard work preparation!

Craft beer, normal beers and wines.

Warm bread rolls, fresh out of the oven.

Scallops in a lobster bisque sauce. Wonderful rich flavour in every mouthful.

Beef cheek, slow cooked, parsnip, celeriac and again an amazing sauce.

Pork belly, melt in the mouth with an explosion of flavour. Toulouse sausage and black pudding.

Perfectly cooked John dory. Light fluffy crispy skin. Amazing.

Fillet steak, mash. Nothing more nothing less. A small pot of pure heaven in the form of a reduced sauce. Magic.

All served with cheese gratin potatoes, and a sort of ratatouille,  courgette and tomatoes.

Magnificent meal.

Deserts. Again perfect.

Rhubarb fool. Shortbread biscuits. Fool light fluffy full of flavour. Ruburb compote underneath. Served in a double walled glass floating in mid air! Excellent shortbread.

Banana custard with crunchy fingers and ice cream. Fizzy melt in your pop. Pops with flavour.

Cheese board. Excellent.

Baileys coffee, cappuccino,  latte and espresso.

It is rare to find a place to eat where everything works seamlessly.

Friendly professional staff, superb food, happy guests and every course perfect. Easy to find 1 good course or another but EVERY course requires dedication from a team who should be proud of their work and results.

I cannot recommend this place more highly. Not expensive, good value for what you receive. (by Francis Moore) [6 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Edited review, been here a good few times now.

A few weeks ago I entered the restaurant just before closing. I was served by a lovely girl called Rachel. I asked if there were any cookies left. She took a look and said there were 2. I said I'd love to have them thanks. A manager in the vicinity commented that I was very nice and told me I was probably their customer of the day. Which I found very nice. As Rachel was grabbing me my cookies, she said that a few more just became available and asked me if I'd like some more. I said I'd take another 2 if possible please. So she handed me 4 cookies. I grabbed my card to pay but she told me that it was okay I could have the other 2 for no extra charge. She wished me a wonderful rest of my night then. I asked her, her name and promised to leave her a good review. Thank you Rachel and her manager for putting a smile in my face and treating me so kindly.

If you're lucky to get the good staff (and if you choose a less busy hour), the food here can be very good and well-sized, although still a bit price-y.

I usually get a large Taco Chip when in here, and as already stated, it can be very hit-or-miss. For 6.50, you can either get a proper massive box of the stuff, or you get a sad little fry box.

If you feel like gambling 6.50 for a Taco Chip (or something else on the menu), this place is recommended.

Only thing (apart from my order) that I need to touch is the doorknob on the way out- though there was hand sanitiser available on the counter. Variety of noodles available means there's plenty of combinations to try, and the meal deal seems a good bargain. (by Emily R Majusiak) [5 years ago] | Review 7: 1 star - Curry was pathetic.

Campagne,Carlow,"The Arches, 5 Gas House Ln, Gardens, Kilkenny, R95 X092, Ireland",Fine dining restaurant,4.7,,,,,"Review 1: 4 stars - 3.5/5 Stars

While the meal was certainly pleasant, it fell short of the exceptional experience one might expect from a Michelin-starred establishment. At this level, I anticipate a notable attention to detail, a flair for creativity, and a consistent elevation in quality. Though the dishes were tasty, none stood out as truly remarkable. The scallop ravioli, however, was a standout: impeccably cooked, perfectly seasoned, and a testament to culinary precision. Unfortunately, the overall experience did not exude the elevated standard associated with Michelin recognition.
The cheese course, in particular, was a point of disappointment‚Äîlacking the sophistication one might hope for in such a setting.
As for the ambiance, the decor was adequate but unremarkable‚Äînothing that would leave a lasting impression or elevate the dining experience beyond the ordinary.
The service, unfortunately, did not align with the expectations one might have for a Michelin-starred venue. The staff, though friendly, lacked the polish and refinement that typically accompanies such an esteemed rating. Issues ranged from simple lapses, such as not remembering which dish belonged to which guest, to more noticeable oversights like failing to present the dessert wine menu before the cheese course, or even neglecting to refill water glasses. Additionally, dirty plates were left on the table for an extended period.
In summary, while the meal was enjoyable, the overall experience did not reflect the caliber typically associated with a Michelin star. There is potential here, but a more focused commitment to detail, both in the kitchen and front of house, is needed to truly distinguish this restaurant. (by Alex H) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Lovely fine dining experience and great food served, albeit not fantastically innovative (not in a bad way). Well curated wine list, and a crowd pleaser dessert menu. (by Zung Tran) [Edited 3 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - A superb meal in relaxed surroundings. The food is beautiful French inspired cuisine where each dish is a delight. Thank you to the incredibly hard working Brid for the warm welcome and the friendly service.The early bird menu is amazing value. (by Ciaran Gordon) [Edited a year ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - My favourite restaurant in Ireland without exception. I honestly haven‚Äôt a single criticism from the multiple times we have tried the lunch and dinner menus. Great value for lunch and exceptional consistently tasty food. Ox cheek, Venison, leek ravioli, pheasant - all incredible. (by Chloe McGovern) [4 weeks ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - The food was nice, but the portions were very small. Staff were friendly but a little overly attentive. The price was a little over the top I was expecting the decor in this place to be top notch it was only ok, seats where not overly comfortable. Overall the experience was OK we had fun the night was made us having a laugh (by Jay Reilly) [11 months ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - This was a birthday treat for me and was my first time in a Michelin starred restaurant. We were running a little late for our booking and called ahead and it was no issue. The staff were so friendly and they were very attentive. The presentation of the food was amazing, such wonderful detail and lovely flavours, we had the early bird which was three courses for 48 euro each. We found this to be reasonable for the dining experience. The starter I had was our favourite dish of the night. Oxtail croquette served in lentils. One word ""beautiful"". I had lamb for mains and was a little underwhelmed, I didn't like the texture of the lamb and I wasn't a fan of the beans served with the dish but that could be just personal preference. The mash on the side was divine as smooth as silk and very rich and buttery. We ordered two sides cauliflower gratin and chips. Both lovely. I had the milk chocolate tart for dessert and again a little underwhelmed. I expected a nice chocolate taste but the flavour was more a burned caramel flavour. The texture was amazing though and again as smooth as silk. I would definitely go back again and would try something different on the menu. (by Margaret Lynch) [a year ago] | Review 7: 3 stars - Food was fine...but for that price I expected more. Not exactly mind blowing flavour coming from any of the dishes. In addition, the waitress at the end asked me if I wanted to give a tip and stared at me as she held out the card machine...I'm sorry but that instantly makes me not want to tip you. (by Kevin) [2 weeks ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Very good experience - made it even better by the outstanding quality price ratio. Small and intimate venue is majestically run by few cordial staff members. The close by parking make the trip to the restaurant smooth and pleasant. Wine list is small but well curated and allows for many ‚Äúglass‚Äù options.

Special kudos for the lamb. Most of the menu has strong French influence leveraging beautiful Irish products.

Definitely a must if <100km away. (by Riccardo Amir Giulianelli) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Cannot say I‚Äôm a foodie. ‚Ä¶.. but I do enjoy food .

Petronella,Carlow,"Butter Slip lane, Co. Kilkenny, Ireland",Modern European restaurant,4.7,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - What an absolute gem of a restaurant in Kilkenny. Make sure you make a reservation in advance!
The rib roast dinner I had was one of the best meals I have ever had! My terms of reference for this statement comes from extensive travels throughout the world.
There is a very deep history with the location of Petronella and the ambiance is so warm and inviting.
Finally, the service was excellent! (by Malcolm Gurley) [a week ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - I had a lovely lunch here in Kilkenny. We started with the pork belly croquettes, which were excellent; the meat was perfectly tender and shredded, and the homemade sauces complemented them really well. For the main course, I had the cottage pie, which was also delicious and full of flavor. The interior is beautifully decorated, with exposed stone and a charming medieval atmosphere that really adds to the experience. On top of that, the staff were very welcoming and genuinely kind. A great spot for lunch, highly recommended! (by Nicolas Fischer) [a month ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Great food. Everything was really good and no complaints at all.

I had the chicken, and the vegetables that came with the plate were out of this world.  The broccoli and carrots that came with this meal were hands down some of the best I‚Äôve ever had.  I only wish this dish came with the mash potatoes that came with my husband‚Äôs short ribs!  Overall the service was great.  The ambience was phenomenal as well.  Highly recommend.

She's a vegetarian and we went to Lennons because I know they will cater for both of us. I love the cup of soup option. I had Hereford beef on sourdough bread which was gorgeous and we were so engrossed chatting I dimly remember my friend's meal - definitely vegetarian with gluten free wrap, which she ate all of. Then for dessert I had the crumble and she had lemon cheesecake- gorgeous.  My coffee was lovely too. Staff excellent and patient. Toilets clean and I was happy to see sanitiser on the wall on the way out. My only gripe is the distance to the carpark as I have mobility issues, but thankfully there were no steps to tackle.

While in a party of 8, this is a solo observation.
The flavours were superb. I had the duck croutons for starters.  There were 3 croutons, each about the size of a dice... eh I'm a big lad,  that was nearly 1 bite.
Haddock with prawns and mussels main.  Again superb taste, a piece of fish 3 inches square,  1 prawn, 3 mussels. Some Nash and green beans.
The starter was ‚Ç¨15, the main ‚Ç¨34. Bottle of OK wine ‚Ç¨47.
I went home and had last night's leftovers.
In short, in my sole opinion,  treat your taste buds on a special occasion,  but have your dinner before you go if you have a decent appetite.

(by Lauren B) [a year ago] | Review 7: 1 star - Went to namo carlow for a takeaway was charged 23.70 for a pulled pork burrito and wedges tapped my card and left after a minute I thought about it and was overcharged. Walked back in the door and told the guy I'd been over charged. Handed him my receipt he told me he would refund me. He done the refund on the card machine on the screen the amount was 0.01 I knew this was wrong and tapped for the refund anyway, I asked the guy for my receipt he wouldn't give it to me he then handed me 7 euros in cash. He would have left me on with a 1 cent refund had I not asked for the receipt. Guys be careful. The burrito it's self was less than average very little pork filling. I wouldn't return again as they were going to do me only I asked for my receipts. I wouldn't recommend much nicer spots to eat for less money with out getting screwed.

But they‚Äôre a bit inconsistent. Sometimes the pizza comes in perfect. But sometimes, the pizza burned badly, come cold, too much jalape√±os or the flavouring of taco sauce is off.

I really hope you guys could improve on this. :) (by Naomi Wang) [2 years ago] | Review 8: 1 star - Parents got food from it recently and were disgusted.

(by Stephen Keogh) [5 days ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - I had a tempura udon (thick noodle soup topped with deep fried shrimp, EUR 21.9) on Monday evening. The ""tempura"" is a bit disappointing, as it is a breaded shrimp and not a light battered one as the tempura should be. The broth is very nice though, you can taste the dried fish from the broth.

Service is good. The atmosphere is nice to sit and meet with friends. Overall, I think Carlow is lucky to have this place. You will hardly find a comparable in Dublin.

We were not impressed by the other server..(sorry to say that) but V (cannot use her full name) was totally well..I was way to afraid to ask for something...no smile no nothing and someone at our table and to get up each time and ask for a knife...how can we cut meat with a dessert spoon?...Thrice we had to get up...and then we were advised she was training Zo√´..
There was no smile no warmth no nothing and I felt uncomfortable üòï her even serving us...I even said...hopefully Zo√´ would come back...

(by Lesley-Anne Kirk) [a year ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Popped in here for a takeaway as opposed to eating in the hotel..
Walked in and was greeted by the guy behind the desk who was very friendly. Placed my order and he offered me a seat while I wait and then he asked if I would like a glass of water then. Such a small gesture that in my 40+years have never been offered in any takeaway ever.
I got the chicken stay skewers and Pad Thai. Sat outside in the sun at the park eating this delicious meal.
Next time I'm in Carlow I will be sitting in and spending my money here. Great food, fantastic service and the restaurant looks really nice.
Thank you Neko! (by OSH) [4 months ago] | Review 9: 2 stars - Food is crazy overpriced for a takeaway. Spent 50 euro on two mains, a salad and some
Prawn crackers. They appear to rip off at ever opportunity. People in front of me asked for a spare box, they made them pay 30 cents for it, through the machine‚Ä¶why bother. I was then given a tiny bag of prawn crackers. Checked the order and told it was a mistake, given a bigger bag‚Ä¶food is fine, but charging the same for takeaway as a dine-in makes no sense. Only one table with any guests and I imagine annoying for them as  people come in to collect takeaway. Just a rip off, trying to gouge at every chance I‚Äôve seen, and food is only fine.

Eddie Rocket's,Carlow,"Merchant House, Shamrock Plaza, Carlow, R93 E4E3, Ireland",Diner,4.4,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 1 star - This would be our 12-15 time eating in the Carlow Rockets.
There was 8 of us and our order was taken by a very nice chap who got the order bang on.
When the food was dropped down we were short two forks for our bacon and cheese fries..
I asked female waitress for two more ‚Ä¶we waited for 10min after getting our food  .. still no forks
Went up to the counter to the same girl who was initially asked, and asked her again for two forks to be told they were out of cutlery and that they were waiting on the dish washer to finish ‚Ä¶.( Note the restaurant was half full ‚Ä¶. and no forks)

5 mins later after our two teenagers tried to eat the food with their fingers the same girl came down and slammed two forks on the table and said ‚Äúthere you go I can‚Äôt make the dish washer machine  wash them any quicker‚Äù and walked away ..
Shocked at what was said to me I got up  ‚Ä¶ went back over to her at the counter and said ‚Äú excuse me, you can have them back(handing her back the forks) and next time,  don‚Äôt be so rude‚Äù
I then returned to our table and continued with our food.
Within 3 minutes a female manager approached our table ‚Ä¶ not to apologise or ask what happened .. but to tell me that I made a child cry and I should ashamed of myself‚Ä¶. (Staff member was 18-20 Y)

The manager went on to try and make our party feel bad  by saying I was aggressive and should be ashamed.
She continue to explain that she would not allow anyone upset her staff and she would back them.

We tried to explain to her what had happened but continued to embarrass herself as a so called manager by telling me I should be ashamed of myself again and again. I asked if she was finished .. and to leave us eat our food ..

The manager returned again for a second time 5 min later to continue where she left off and still continued to try and defend the actions of her staff member ‚Ä¶

I told her that if she felt her staffs actions were correct then her management skills needed to be looked at.
Maybe next time the staff member should hand wash a few forks instead of making customers wait ‚Ä¶.

Eddie Rockets clearly need to look at what way they train their managers .. while sticking up for your staff is admiral ‚Ä¶ you need to find out both sides of the story before telling a customer they should be ashamed of themselves ‚Ä¶ crazy outcome to an over priced take away.

Won‚Äôt be rushing back ‚Ä¶ ‚Ç¨150 spent on burgers, abuse and no forks ‚Ä¶ thanks for the memorable experience Eddie Rockets (by Dan Morrissey) [a month ago] | Review 2: 1 star - Me and my girlfriend and her friend went in, they are Italians and the waiter with the glasses was very welcoming. He gave us our seats with no hassle but when we were ordering, as we didn‚Äôt understand the menu we asked about the ‚Äúcombo‚Äù. The lady said ‚Äúwe have soft drinks‚Äù but since my girlfriend didn‚Äôt hear her correctly she said ‚Äúhow do you people say it, soda?‚Äù (it says soda on the menu by the way).
Off the bat this lady has been giving dirty looks pointing at us to colleagues. A waiter then came with her and asked us for our order; when my girlfriend‚Äôs friend turn came, she asked for a smash burger and asked if there was pork in it. The lady said no, but the meat was not halal. She then said that her chefs, as muslims, they only eat chicken.
The woman kept arguing about it as if she was Muslim, she refused to give us food and asked for all of us to leave. The waiter was visibly shocked too.

I wish I was over exaggerating but I‚Äôm not, honestly the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had in any restaurant in my 18 years of living, all because of a white lady with dark, a red shirt and a wrinkly face. (by Fionn warfield) [a month ago] | Review 3: 1 star - I wish I could rate the food, but due to my experience I can‚Äôt.
Me, my boyfriend and my friend went in, a waiter gave us the menu and since me and my friend never went there, we asked a woman either dark hair and a red shirt who was working there to explain the menu for us. After that, her and a waiter came by to take our orders and since my friend is muslim, I asked if there was pork in the beef. She said ‚Äúno, but our beef is not halal‚Äù.
My friend, who‚Äôs a fellow believer of her religion, wanted to order the meal anyway due to the absence of pork in the meat, but the woman did not allow her, justifying herself by saying that her cookers are muslim and that they only eat chicken. She didn‚Äôt even consult them, so how can a non-muslim woman be so sure of something she‚Äôs not part of?
This is not the first time that my friend went to a fast food restaurant, so she definitely knows what she‚Äôs doing.
The woman did not want her to allow her to order the meal she wanted and she ended up kicking us out and accusing my friend to be a nonbeliever, after removing the menu from our hands and accusing my friend of being rude, ignorant and mean.

Me and my friend are from Italy and we just wanted to have a nice time before leaving. We‚Äôve traveled around the world and this has never happened to us. I don‚Äôt wish this upon anyone, because I believe that a restaurant must be polite, professional and show respect to the customers.

(by a kr) [Edited a year ago] | Review 6: 1 star - I work as a delivery courier for Just Eat and had an order from this restaurant. I waited 40 minutes for the order. When I asked how much longer it would take, the server first just said ‚Äòsorry‚Äô ‚Äî which doesn‚Äôt really help. The second time I asked, she told me I could leave the order and go, and that I shouldn‚Äôt come back, speaking to me in a rude and irritated tone. I find this attitude completely unprofessional and unacceptable.

We visited this place, Friday evening, 9 PM, 17th of June. One enters a small entrance & reception hall. To the right is the dining room, quite small but cozy. We had a table for 9 persons which was placed near the door. Once seated, it took a long time before our orders were taken. I did not fancy any starter but my wife had the tomatoe soup of the day which she thought was good. I ordered & got Pan Fried Skate Fish. The fish tasted good. It was fried without any flour coating, had a crab-meat-like texture, nutty flavor, low in salt, lacked a little taste of lemon & had a little melted butter as sauce. It was served with fried asparagus, a small tomatoe & a couple of fried prawns, together with fried potatoe bits & boiled broccoli. I had a glass of white wine with the meal. Lastly, we had coffee & dessert, I had warm Chocolate Fondant served with a scoup of Chocolate Ice Cream, with streaks of chocolate sauce. It was quite an enjoyable dinner with relatives.

The food was always excellent, and it's always the highlight of our visit.

However this time it was only mediocre.  The onion rings were tasteless and over cooked.  The battered burger was also overcooked and the batter was hard on one side it was like glass shards when bitten into.  The burger and chips were on the lower side of tasty.

Upon discussion of our food, we realised there were different staff there, so perhaps it has changed owners and they do not have the cooking skills of the previous staff.

Very disappointing, we won't be stopping there again.

The three star rating is only on account of friendly service. (by T K) [3 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Eat from here every other week.

I did telephone for a bag of chips and 1  batter sausage for collection on a week day evening for collection (6.50) euros ..I was told be ready in 5 minutes but it was over 20 minutes before I got my order...

Billies Grill and Chinese Restaurant - Coffee House,Carlow,"1 Kennedy St, Carlow, R93 C2R7, Ireland",Restaurant,4.2,,,Crystals Chinese Takeaway ¬∑ 4.2 stars ¬∑ 64 reviews ¬∑ Chinese Takeout,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 4 stars - Review Date: 25 SEP 2025
The only Halal restaurant in town that offers chinese, grill, and takeaway style kebabs/doner options.

I tried chef special chow mein which was ok, but runny, which was a usual twist.

On another occasion I ordered Half grilled chicken platter. grilling was perfect but chicken had almost no taste. Still, with the crispy skin and absolutely gorgeous fries it dis the job.

The salad on the other hand killed the joy as it appeared to be straight out of Tesco salad bag stored overnight. I think either you serve fresh salad or completely skip it otherwise it will ruin everything.

I found the service to be dull although it wasn‚Äôt busy on both of the occasions.

Still, i will keep going back as we have very limited options in town (by Omer Ali) [a week ago] | Review 2: 2 stars - Do not order Chinese food in this restaurant. Beef was like a chewing gum, sauce had no taste. Did not enjoy meal at all. However service was ok, only that starter and main course was brought to the table at the same time. Environment is lovely, music playing in background. (by Inga Da≈°keviƒçienƒó) [2 weeks ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Nestled in the heart of Carlow is a charming little diner that's worth its weight in gold. With its cozy ambiance and friendly staff, dining here feels like visiting an old friend's home. The menu boasts classic comfort food done right, from hearty Dinners to mouthwatering burgers and Kebabs. But what truly sets this diner apart is its attention to detail and commitment to quality ingredients. Each dish is prepared with love, and it shows in every bite. Whether you're a local or just passing through, this diner is a must-visit for anyone craving a taste of genuine hospitality and delicious food in Carlow (by Jordan McCarthy) [a year ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - This is my absolute favorite restaurant in carlow, cozy interior, The food is always fantastic and no matter what I order I am always delighted with my meal! This time we had billies special burger and the crispy chicken sub both were super delicious the burger could use some pickles tho for that extra flavor, the apple tart was okay..
The Servers are also great and always efficient, happy and polite. Can‚Äôt wait to return and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to eat in carlow. It‚Äôs Halal too. (by Enas Meshref) [3 years ago] | Review 5: 1 star - Ordered mix kebab and spicy bag. Donor was rotten and smell of it was allover the house, we said let's taste it, then we got sick myself and my kids. When I rang the restaurant they said all ok and no issues thinking I was looking for free food, even if they give us free food will not eat anything from this place anymore. Food went to the bin as the spicy bag has no taste at all. If you don't believe then order and you will lose your money and get sick from the food. Last time to order from this place!

Is the food good? It's OK it's  nice but nothing special. They would massively benefit from focusing on a much smaller menu and thus focus on that food but trying to do kebabs/italian/Chinese/takeaway/spice bag/takeaway/pasta etc all at once Is nuts.
Rein it in focus on few very good dishes at once and see things change. Trying to do several cuisines at once is bonkers no??

Obviously it's gonna be cold if left overnight??? We had to drive in and give them back the food, to go elsewhere but no refund or apology or anything.

The bar is a cosy traditional Irish bar, I wish I could of sat there all day, the restaurant is spacious and attached to the bar with a diverse menu, the duck dish I got was delicious, and most importantly the staff were all friendly and a credit to the establishment. (by Ciaran Bernard) | Review 7: None - I had my wedding in the lord bagnall on the 29/aug/25 and i have to say it was amazing. All down to the staff who were so good especially niall and karen who were brilliant and professional. I cud not fault one thing about this hotel. They even let me come in a few days before and set up the room to what i wanted which was great.  Not just the service but the food is also fabulous. All our guests cudnt believe how good it was.  So a big thank u to everyone who works there inc the owner himself as he cudnt have done enough for us. He was all hands on which was great to see and very unusual but it does go a long way:))) (by Anne Hyland) | Review 8: None - Great location next to the river and grand foyer area. The bar and outside terrace area are both very comfortable. The dinner options were good and the curry, fish of the day and hamburger were all enjoyed. The brownie, cheesceake and bread and butter pudding were also more than up to scratch. (by Jo Gar) | Review 9: None - Stopped off for a breakfast buffet . The selection was well thought out and well presented. |I loved the decor in the lobby and the bathrooms, the staff were pleasant and helpful so the atmosphere was very welcoming.  |Leighlinbridge is a hidden historical  gem and worth a visit.

The service was simply unbelievable ‚Äî every detail was looked after with such care, making us and our guests feel truly special throughout the whole day. The food was outstanding, with so many of our guests telling us it was the best wedding meal they‚Äôve ever had!

A huge thank you to James, Nial, Sue, and the entire team ‚Äî you were all amazing. Nothing was too much trouble, and you made everything run so smoothly, allowing us to relax and just enjoy every moment.

Stopped here, based on reviews.
They don't lie .
Wonderful service, cute coffee shop with plenty of seating.
Excellent latte , with fresh out of the oven scone.
It could not be more perfect!
Highly recommend. (by Barry Sullivan) [a month ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - The food here can be really hit or miss. For instance today I ordered the porridge but got served it with a different milk than I had previously asked for with the porridge and wasn‚Äôt told they had ran out of berry compote and instead just got served a spoon of jam on top, while last week I ordered the exact same thing and it was exquisite. The same can be said for the pancakes, sometimes they‚Äôre cooked to perfection and sometimes they‚Äôre a little burnt. The food is a little slow coming out which I don‚Äôt mind on the days the foods amazing because I can appreciate that it‚Äôs freshly made. I will stay that the staff are amazing and friendly and I‚Äôm always greeted with a smile whenever I go on. A young man who waits (I think he‚Äôs named Clayton I could be wrong) is extremely friendly and definitely an amazing attribute to the cafe. Overall this is one of my favorite cafes in Carlow although I do recommend the waiters write the orders down so a mistake like the wrong milk doesn‚Äôt happen again.

Highly recommended (by Enas Meshref) [3 years ago] | Review 9: 1 star - Got 2 americanos and 2 cartons of ribena. ‚Ç¨13.30. Coffee was weak and watery.  First cup was supposed to be black but it looked like weak tea with no milk  you could see the bottom of the cup it was that weak. Second cup looked like a cup of tea with milk not much to taste there either.
But kids did like the ribena.
Overall I felt like I just wasted my hard earned cash. We didn't drink them. The van looks great and inviting.  But the best advice I can give on my experience iis to walk past and go to Costa or tesco  at least you can taste there coffee. I would have went back only we were on the road.

Butcher Restaurant,Carlow,"The Butterslip, St Kieran's St, Gardens, Kilkenny, R95 T3VX, Ireland",Steak house,4.7,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Step into the cozy, homey haven of Butcher, where every bite tells a story! This charming gem of a restaurant is owned by Matt, a passionate cow farmer who raises 250 head of Hereford and Angus beef right here in the local fields. No hormones, no water-pumped fluff‚Äîjust pure, grass-fed goodness butchered on-site. Matt spent a delightful 10 minutes at our table, sharing how he went from selling his premium beef to the previous owner to impulsively taking the reins himself. His mission? To serve honest, high-quality beef that shuns the bloated, hormone-heavy cuts flooding American menus. It‚Äôs all about flavor over flash here, with a nod to classic home cooking.
The vibes are warm, the sides are playful, and the cocktails? Absolute perfection. You have to order the ‚ÄúCowboy,‚Äù a jaw-dropping 14oz bone-in rib eye that‚Äôs pure melt-in-your-mouth magic. Service strikes the perfect balance‚Äîswift but never rushed. Look up, and you‚Äôll spot the quirky cow bars lining the ceiling, a nod to Matt‚Äôs inspiration from another U.S. restaurant, now adorned with hooks holding twinkling lights instead of meat.
Don‚Äôt sleep on this hidden treasure‚ÄîButcher‚Äôs prices are as reasonable as its portions are generous. Trust me, this is a dining experience you won‚Äôt forget!

The Merry Tree - Rathwood,Carlow,"Rath, Carlow, R93 CX74, Ireland",Restaurant,3.9,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 2 stars - I would not recommend this restaurant to any coeliac due to the limited options, even if the web page and other reviews claim more options that is not the case. The cross contamination is on another level and the only redeeming quality about this restaurant is that you can go on a walk in Rathwood.

I ordered a salad, as this was the only coeliac friendly option with no worry about cross contamination. However, I was disappointed to find that the strawberries in my salad were old and mouldy. When I raised this complaint to staff, I was given a new salad with no mouldy strawberries, however, nothing further was done about the issue and there was no apology.  The food was just not fresh so nevermind even the cross contamination issues but the food being old is bad enough.

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone at all. (by Dorota Dabek) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Had a lovely meal here with family. Did not have a reservation, however we were seated promptly even though the restaurant was busy upon our arrival. Stunning indoor decor.

The food was absolutely delicious! (by Ugne M.) [a year ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - Food nearly stone cold coming out of the carvery stood waiting nearly 10 minutes to pay (place was quiet not busy at all) all while my food was getting even colder. Told the lady who was manning the till and she flat out ignored me until I literally had to ask her did she hear what I said. Was then rudely told she could put it in the microwave or go tell the kitchen myself. Not her department apparently even though she was taking payment. Food was cold, mediocre and the gravy had a weird aftertaste. Only reason 3 stars were allocated for service is because Liz the lady who seated and looked after us was absolutely lovely (by Ash Keith) [a month ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Staff were very friendly ,food very tasty i had the vegan burger.

We were greeted at door by a lovely waitress and were seated. The menu has a great variety of dishes and very reasonably priced. I ordered the chicken bap and my daughter ordered caesar salad.

Both the waitress and the manager magda brought out our desserts with a birthday candle in my daughters dessert whilst singing happy birthday to my daughter, which was a lovely surprise. Staff are amazing and really look after you, they couldn't be more helpful. The restaurant is very clean.

Pure dogs (by Jordan) [Edited a year ago] | Review 6: 1 star - Where to begin? A group of about 14 of us decided on this fine establishment for our annual get together. Disappointed is not the word. To begin, the staff were very pleasant but the services was okay at best. We were there for over 3 hours simply due to the slow pace of taking orders and poor structure to the complicated menu. After what I admit was a lot of food a few of us started to feel queasy. For me this feeling quickly turned into serious pain followed by some hardcore throwing up. I can‚Äôt say it was any one food in particular but if I had to guess it was the undercooked chicken or dodgy curry triangles. Personally, I‚Äôll never go back but this could have been a particularly poor night as I‚Äôve seen they have consistently good reviews. To conclude, no better than any take away. (by Shane Butler) [6 years ago] | Review 7: 1 star - I was very disappointed at going to ho ting tonight. Everytime I brought my family to ho thing the food and service was excellent, I went tonight and ordered food the restaurant was empty but service was slow. At the end of the meal I found out the menu I received before the meal was changed and new staff that were working got it wrong. They gave great service but the management said we got the wrong menus as they had to up the price due to changes in the economy and have no problem with that but should have been informed before ordering. my family were very disappointed but I believe when you read from a menu  everyone can order from different price range and not one table to order the same set meal deal.. everyone is a customer.. I have no problem  paying extra.. due to economy  change. But be bullied at the till. From a personal  opinion I think if management  was to change prices to up date  prices please update the menus and inform the staff. That's managements job. Not new staff.

At end of day
Ask before you order . The cost of dinner before you order..

Because they take advantage of you in front of your family and friends.

I believe  in small business around are community but that  take the piss.

Special if a child under 10 ordering  food . And its 1 starter 1 main for ‚Ç¨10 charging ‚Ç¨2.50 a dash of coke..

I would of highly  recommend  this company  in the last 2 years..
But disappointed  shame on you

Just be sure to let them cool for a minute or two. Road House has a variety of daily meals and an assortment of student meals also for those who would like to save a bit of money.

And seeing your enthusiasm was a blast.
Mesmerised by the tall, handsome man,
Making pizza as best as he can.

With crust now running through my vein,
Don‚Äôt worry - you‚Äôll see me again.

My partner gets a filter coffee from the lovely Clayton and a fruit scone. The filter is incredible and beautifully presented. It‚Äôs lovely sitting outside and watching the pour through the hatch and then  delivered by the man himself who is always up for a bit of a chat. We never leave without a bag of Farmhouse coffee and a sourdough. We have tried their soups in the winter as well as a very tasty French toast with cherry and meringue! I cannot fault this place. Every member of staff go above and beyond even when the place is jammers! It‚Äôs the best. (by Amy Kenealy) [2 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Waterlilies is one of my favourite spots in Carlow, I‚Äôve been in a few times and it never disappoints. The food is always good (especially the french toast), the vibes are relaxed and welcoming, and the staff are super friendly. Hands down the best matcha in Carlow and the coffee is great too. Definitely worth a visit if you‚Äôre in the area. (by Martyna Paczek) [2 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Went for breakfast a few weeks ago. Been before for coffee and cookies but never got to try any of the dishes.. so we had the breakfast bap never seen it before so didnt know what to expect. Now I'm no veggie in any way but Holy Moly it was unbelievable. The hash brown and halloumi cheese were outta this world.. I still think about it and we've told everyone who will listen that this dish is phenomenal. Will 100% be back to try more dishes and expand my palette. (by Kerri Rourke) [3 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Waterlilies is the best caf√© in all of Ireland.  The food is all freshly made and the baked goods are out of this world.

The service is exceptional. Abigail and the team are always helpful and Clayton hasn‚Äôt let us down with recommendations on any new products.
The atmosphere is so relaxed, exactly what I want when I visit. It‚Äôs a must visit when you are in Carlow.
The fact it‚Äôs dog friendly is a big bonus too as we can call in after our walks every weekend. (by Aoife) [2 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - The team here is always warm and welcoming. Clayton, in particular, greets every guest with a genuine smile. Their coffee is beautifully crafted, and the selection of home-baked sweet treats is irresistible.

It didn‚Äôt seem too busy at the time, and there were two staff working the coffee machine, but service was quite slow. I had already paid by card so didn‚Äôt have time to request a refund. On a positive note, the pastries looked delicious. Hopefully next time the coffee service will be a bit quicker.

(by Allie lumme) [6 months ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - Food was great but the service quite appalling.  Like, how hard is it to serve the only three tables that were dining, I wonder what is the experience like when all tables are occupied, I doubt it ever does with such behaviour. Lack of staff attending tables or even caring if the customer wants anything. Just hiding behind the desk and kitchen doesn't run a restaurant!! Also if you don't have some items in the menu then don't have it in the menu. It didn't look like staff wanted to serve people. Server not familiar with menu not asking if the dishes are to be prepared mild or hot or normal. After finishing eating we literally had to wait for more than 25 minutes and no one would even come out to see if we need anything or we want to pay the bill etc. Another surprise is when another customer came in at exactly an hour or 55 mins before closure and they said they will do only take away and not dine in. It was crazy to think that a restaurant who are not at all busy and has a sparse footfall will do this !! The two stars although are only because the food was good, not super good but just good.

The wait time is a put off. If they just told you the time it was going to take it wouldn't be as frustrating.

Metro Grill,Carlow,"Tullow St, Carlow, Ireland",Takeout restaurant,4.0,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 5 stars - Wow I must say it was delicious! I would highly recommend this place ! üëå (by Beata Nowak) [6 months ago] | Review 2: 3 stars - Review Date: 19 June 2025

I have mixed feelings about this review as I‚Äôd be rating two menu items that I have recently tried here.

First, their mixed grill kebab with Naan bread ( lamb doner meat + grilled chicken tikka) is amazing. Fresh, right balance of flavor and spices and very generous portion. The dips are amazing and adds a great punch to the flavor. I also love their naan bread which is always fresh and crisp.

On the other hand I tried their Chicken Supreme Pizza on multiple occasions and it made me hate Pizzas for the very first time. The dough is ok-ish, a very low quality cheese, Chicken cubes were not even boiled properly. The pizza had a distinct smell and an uncooked flavor profile.
Also, I believe Pizzas are over priced. (by Omer Ali) [Edited 2 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Never disappointed. 16"". Generous toppings, taste full of flavour.

When i asked the man at the counter where he was from (Afghanistan), and told him that i am american, he immediately started accusing me and my country of being evil, for all sorts of distorted ideas of what america has done. I tried to actually communicate with him about it but he did not want to listen to anything i had to say. Instead he just kept talking over me louder and louder until hes standing there for 5+ minutes yelling at me about how terrible i am for being american instead of making my food. Don't eat here.

This comment was not only unnecessary but also incredibly embarrassing. He felt singled out in an uncomfortable way, as if we were being chastised for something as trivial as the order of who spoke first. It was a completely inappropriate remark that added to the overall unwelcoming atmosphere. The service was not only unwelcoming but also dismissive, which completely overshadowed our visit.

(by Aaron Donnelly) [3 days ago] | Review 5: 1 star - I placed an order for an outdoor dining set and cover on May 19th. I chose the wait and save option which meant I was to receive my delivery in June or July. I was informed by customer service that there was a delay with the shipment which is was totally fine with. August came and I was notified my furniture had landed in Carlow and was due to be dispatched within 3-7 working days. These days past so I called customer service, after a long wait and a pleasant conversation I was reassured that my furniture would be on the next delivery out. I waited again, still no sign. I sent many emails and again received pleasant replies from different members of the customer service team, always reassuring me that they were doing their very best. I finally asked for a refund on September 4th when I felt I could no longer believe what I was being told regarding my delivery. Again I was forced to send many emails regarding my refund as I had not received the money or confirmation that it had been processed. I have lost count of the interactions I've had with the Rathwood customer service team. As time went on it took longer for replies. I was told on the 20th of September that my refund would be processed rapidly. Today, the 29th of September I was forced to go against my nature and have a very angry phone call with the Rathwood customer service team. I was upset I was forced to do this but I was on the brink of legal action as this goes against consumer rights act 2022 section 31.
This experience has truly been awful, distressing and beyond dissapointing. To think that this company can get away with this behaviour is just so upsetting. Please go elsewhere (by lisa glynn) [6 days ago] | Review 6: 1 star - Unfortunately,  I wasn't able to leave zero stars.
I'm still waiting to be reimbursed a significant sum for firewood purchased in March which was not delivered.Very disappointed that Rathwood are not refunding my money and have been ignoring my emails. So after six months, I have neither my money - nor the firewood. Strange way to run a business; anyone else having this experience? (by S. Irwin) [a week ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - I had a very positive experience with Faye in Rathwood. She went over and beyond to help me in getting a replacement part for a parasol after it was damaged by the wind. Despite this being outside the products warranty, Faye went out of her way to source a replacement piece and for it to be sent out by courier. I would rate my customer experience in Rathwood highly. Thank you Faye. 5 star service. (by Theresa Clare) [2 weeks ago] | Review 8: 1 star - I purchased a bed on September 4
I purchased a bed on September 4, 2025, and received order confirmation immediately after paying for the product, including shipping. On September 9, 2025, I contacted Rathwood via their website to find out the estimated delivery date, and the response was: ""Thanks for getting in touch. Stocks are from our UK warehouse. Once they arrive at the Ireland warehouse, typically every Wednesday, they will be promptly prepared for dispatch, which usually takes 5 to 10 working days."" Okay, I waited until September 25, 2025, and asked again about the delivery, since they hadn't sent me any update. AGAIN, THE SAME RESPONSE: ""Hello Guilherme, Thanks for getting in touch. Stocks are from our UK warehouse. Once they arrive at the Ireland warehouse, typically every Wednesday, they will be promptly prepared for dispatch, which usually takes 5 to 10 working days. Once arrived at the warehouse, the courier will be in touch via text message for the delivery date, and you'll have the opportunity to accept or rearrange."" This is disrespectful to the customer and disrespectful of our time and money, as they don't position us correctly. Not to mention that there's an order update like this: September 19, 2025
Order was canceled. CANCELLED BY WHOM? No one contacted me or gave me a refund. No explanation, just the same bizarre response. (by Guilherme de Souza Lopez) [a week ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Fantastic food, waiting staff and very clean place.
Portion of the lunch menu is incredible.  You cannot say I have spend to much. The Roast beef was delicious,  the gravy is not like all restaurant make from powder.  Very tasty gravy sauce.  Very soft slow cooked beef.
Chicken oven baked,  juicy and tender.  Stuffing was very good as well. Mashed potatoes fresh and. Water taste like a water, no chlorine smell or taste so must be filtered and big credit for that. Juice was also in good price.  Chefs special which was chicken only ‚Ç¨14.50
Thank you for good food. Best regards (by Lukasz Smetek) [3 months ago] | Review 10: 2 stars - Ordered garden furniture in April on a scheme they call pay and wait . I paid in full and was told I‚Äôd get furniture in early June . Unfortunately they kept changing delivery dates and I still hadn‚Äôt received furniture early  August and was then told it would be September ( üòÇ summer over ) . I cancelled order  and was told it would be 14 days for refund . I dealt with Reine and I always got a reply from her regarding updates . I got fully refunded on 20th August . I have bought many times from Rathwood but never experienced this delay ever . If you can wait months for goods ( which in fairness are of high standard) to be delivered then order from them if not go elsewhere .

Statham‚Äôs by Pembroke Kilkenny,Carlow,"11 Patrick St, Gardens, Kilkenny, R95 VNP4, Ireland",Restaurant,4.5,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - We were fortunate to be able to dine here while spending the night at the Pembroke Hotel. Our dinner was amazing, as was the service, and everyone loved the dessert options as well. We went to the hotel‚Äôs bar for drinks afterwards and had an absolutely perfect experience. (by Sandra Hornak) [4 months ago] | Review 2: 1 star - The atmosphere is nice, and the service was good with friendly staff. However, the food was absolutely shocking. We had the loaded potatoes, which were basically potato chips with a can of tomato sauce on top. We had the caesar salad which should not be called a salad, as we had basically no lettuce, 5000 pounds of dressing, and what looked like an entire chicken shredded on top. Very disappointing. The prawn tacos, the prawns themselves were good, the taco shell tasted stale, and the mango sauce on top tasted like hand soap. So a hand soap taco, with prawns. I was hungry when I left, and 60 euros more poor. Will never be back. (by Kyra Todd) [a week ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Stopped by ,spur of the moment, on our way to Cork. They seated us right away. Very clean and the food was great. Strawberry cream cocktail and a smithwicks red ale. Very good. Light music playing in the background, was a excellent touch. They validate your parking on a certain street. I ordered a steak sandwich and I was surprised I loved all the toppings. He ordered shrimp salad and enjoyed the as well. Hostess was super nice and paid attention when she needed to. (by Bee) [a year ago] | Review 4: 2 stars - I guess it would be grand if you are with a man.  In 20 minutes my sister and I were ignored twice while tables with a man were waited on. Only four tables in total and one was done so to have such rude disregard from the waiter was so unacceptable we left.  Excellent service and food just a few steps down the street at the Hibernian bar with excellent door and Service    Beautiful bar area (by Cynthia Marsh) [2 weeks ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Breakfast tasted nice but we wish someone offered water, juice, toast, etc. since it's not a buffet, just a menu card with beverages explaining what's available would be nice. Felt bad chasing down the server three times.  Very friendly but not entirely attentive. (by Jake Slutzky) [a year ago] | Review 6: 2 stars - I ordered a Sirloin steak with pepper sauce and I think the Chef ought to have his licence to use salt revoked.

The sauce made what was otherwise a nice well cooked piece of beef almost inedible for me.

My wife had a sticky pudding with caramel that was also overdosed with salt.

Some chefs mistake salt for flavour and I'm not a fan at all. (by Paul Connolly) [3 months ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Overall a good experience. Food was tasty but the chips (fries) were right out of a frozen bag. For the cost and scale of this place hand cut chips would have been more appealing also they were cold to make matters worse. Staff were excellent, super nice and polite. Seats and table were lovely and comfortable. I would go back again and would recommend the steak. (by Gerard Newsham) [5 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - This was by far the best meal I have eaten in a very long time ! If you take a trip to Kilkenny you must visit the Statham‚Äòs by Pembroke it is so worth it! (by Lilly Hauer) [6 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Very delicious food at a reasonable price. Good service from the staff and dog friendly outside area! (by Judy Burne) [3 months ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Sadly no idea what food was like - we didn't get any.  Likewise, the only thing I can say about the service was that we didn't get any.

We entered the dining room to be greeted with a grunt to pick our own table.  Having done so, we sat for 10 minutes during which nobody acknowledged us. Not even a glance in our direction.  We left shortly afterwards.  Nobody noticed is leaving.

The approach to service seemed to be, ""ignore them and maybe they'll go away"".  Well, job done.

Don't waste your time.  There are better options in Kilkenny.

The atmosphere was warm and inviting, the music was entertaining and I felt as if I could have a conversation without feeling like I had to shout to be heard. The staff are so friendly and welcoming will definitely be back again just on this alone. For food my partner had the 8oz steak burger, staff ask you allow 15 minutes of a wait for the burger to be made fresh and safe to say it was worth the wait. The burger was cooked to perfection, it was juicy and tender. I had the homemade lasagna and boy was it delicious with real Irish beef mince and homemade coleslaw. 10/10 highly recommend for anyone to go here if given the chance to.

The place looks so much more modern and inviting - a sleek and stylish new look.

The food was great, the staff were extremely friendly, I'm definitely going to come back here a lot!

I came here for my fianc√©'s birthday and there was a great variety in the menu, I went for the onion bhaji for starter and Pork Belly roulade for mains, both really flavoursome and plated great. Beef bourguinon special was tender and the portion was huge, actually all portions are incredibly generous, I would actually say you could cut that back haha

We were too full for dessert but received a lovely Happy Birthday plate from the guys which was very generous and a nice little touch.

Cocktails are also great - a great spot much needed in Cavan.

Go here! (by Stephanie Barry) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - I had a wonderful experience at People‚Äôs Restaurant.

We tried a few different dishes, including the wings, mushroom toast, Korean chicken, supreme of chicken, which were good, but again I wasn't overly blown away. It's still a very nice restaurant to visit if in Cavan town. (by Dermot Breen) [8 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Such a fab looking hotel and the atmosphere but the cocktails and food is simply amazing best food I‚Äôve had in a very long time can‚Äôt wait to go back (by Kelly Murray) [7 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - First timers here. We opted for the Early bird menu (2 courses for ‚Ç¨27.50 & option of adding a dessert for ‚Ç¨5). I was impressed that this was an option on a Saturday night until 6.30pm. Some specials were also available.
To commence, I opted for the crispy beef and truffle dim sum and my husband had the homemade black pudding croquettes. We shared each other's dishes throughout the meal in case the other ordered better! The Dim Sum was the standout winner of that round: so sapid. The croquettes were tasty though lacked some moisture as we felt they were a little dry overall.
For mains, I ordered the southern fried chicken burger with chips and the other half ordered the Thai curry with chicken served with half rice and chips. The curry was the highlight of that round: again fabulous flavour though we gave it a 9/10: some added vegetables to the curry would have been perfect.
I was at capacity at this point but my bottomless husband chose the Eaton mess. He reported it was glorious. I did taste it and the berry compote was very impressive. I enjoyed watching him eat this with pure pleasure. He gave it a 10/10.

This restaurant deserves to do well. Hats off to the chef(s). We will return and know what we will order the next time already! We thought the earlybird in terms of value, quality and choice was commendable. Service was spot on. Keep up the standard.

I actually got sick while I was there and she not only helped me get in to see a doctor but she also drove me to my appointment. I don't think I would have been able to go to the wedding had she not been so helpful.

The house itself was beautiful and well kept. When I was in my room I didn't even hear the other guests coming and going. It was very quiet and peaceful. The view was also completely serene. I couldn't have imagined it could be any more perfect than it was.

Unfortunately, the experience inside the hotel didn‚Äôt live up to the setting.

We stayed during a warm, very busy weekend, and it felt like the high volume of guests affected service. The reception staff seemed overwhelmed and not particularly welcoming. The rooms were stuffy, outdated, and lacked air conditioning, which made sleeping uncomfortable. The shower had inconsistent water temperature, and the amenities overall were in poor condition.

Dining was also disappointing. While my starter and dessert at dinner were nice, the main course was very dry and not enjoyable. The breakfast buffet was the biggest letdown, it was practically inedible.

One important note: this hotel is extremely family- and child-friendly. So much so that there were often more children than adults, running, shouting, and playing unsupervised throughout the hotel, including in the bar, both day and night. If you're looking for a peaceful or relaxing stay, this may not be the right choice. (by Nina Hagemann) | Review 9: None - Lovely staff. Lovely experience.

Bar tender. I go there every lunch time it is a fantastic place for food and the ATMOSPHERE is brilliant and the female staff are unbelievably helpful. However the male bartender or manager is extremely rude and always has been towards me regardless of the fact I'm there everyday of not every second day. He rudely told me the coffee machine was off today and only beer orsger was available i asked for a frappachino and was told beer or lager only.
There was no signs for this and seemed as if it was only done as the male bartender in charge knew I would be ordering coffee. He has had a horrible attitude towards me for months and was extremely rude and made me feel unworthy to be there.
I felt discriminated against entirely (by Niamh Mccullagh) [4 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - This is a great place to dine and take in a match or two.

Ordered a customized special Coffee flavored birthday cake. The cake design was absolutely lovely and it looked mouth watering. The coffee flavor was just right, however a tiny issue was that it was way over-sweet, too much sugar that you could almost feel the sugar granules. If the sweetness was to get reduced slightly, I'd give the cake a 5 star! But overall a friendly staff, great service and on time. I will still try their other cakes for sure! : ) (by Sal The Enthusiast) [4 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Definitely one of the top spots in Cavan town.

There was no notice on the online order system for this. Mains weren't yet available from the brunch menu so we had a club sandwich and shakshuka. The shakshuka was terrible. A big bowl of tomato/pepper/onion sauce and two overcooked eggs in the middle. The smoothies tasted synthetic - must be using concentrated juice in them.

Cavan Adventure Centre,Cavan,,Canoe & kayak rental service,4.8,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Our visit to Cavan Adventure Centre was absolutely outstanding from start to finish! My extended family and I had such an unforgettable day filled with adventure, laughter, and impeccable hospitality.

The boat trip was a highlight of the day. Siobhan, our skipper, was fantastic‚Äîher professionalism and charm made the journey so enjoyable. The tour guide was equally amazing‚Äîbrimming with knowledge and always ready to help, ensuring we felt safe, informed, and entertained throughout.

A special mention has to go to Sean, the owner, who truly went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. His kindness and accommodating nature were second to none‚Äîhe genuinely could not have done more to ensure we all had an incredible experience.

After the boat trip, we had great fun on the swan boats‚Äîperfect for all ages and such a delightful activity. I even tried my hand at kayaking, which was an absolute blast. The centre provided such a variety of activities that there was something for everyone to enjoy.

I can't recommend Cavan Adventure Centre highly enough! It‚Äôs the perfect destination for families, groups, or anyone looking to create wonderful memories. We‚Äôll definitely be back. (by Conor Mahony) [6 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - when my family failed me on our canoeing adventure by refusing to paddle after roughly five minutes out on the lake, my day was about to end in disaster, but the team at the Cavan Adventure Centre came to my rescue. I was allowed to try kayaking and embark on my very own adventure on Lough Oughter and it was absolutely fantastic and so much fun. an amazing experience for both experienced rowers and fledglings like me. (by charlie just charlie) [a year ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - I was super excited to rent a kayak and check out the castle, however they would not rent to me because I was alone.

Strawberry tart with elderflower sorbet was really good, sorbet was gorgeous. Drinks orders were a bit slow but not the end of the world. Overall great food with a few minor let downs.

We've dined here many times and yet somehow it keeps getting better and better. The restaurant itself is lovely and the service is impeccable. As for the food you can see the chefs standards are at the absolute highest and the chef should take a bow for not only how his food is cooked but also displayed. Honestly and my wife agreed there wasn't a single thing to complain about. Not a single thing. Oak Room is by far leading the way for fine dining in Co Cavan and if your local or just passing through it's an absolute must to stop here. Cant recommend highly enough.

Shows very well run (by Carmel) [11 months ago] | Review 5: 1 star - This is a wonderful facility and only getting better. The problem is that there is zero transparency in the stable booking process for the bigger shows. Blocks of stables are very clearly reserved in advance for preferred clients and kept out of the pool when the online sale goes live. All of the stables sell out within minutes and somehow, so does the waiting list, which requires one to email the office. You'd be more likely to get Oasis tickets. There is also no forewarning about when the stables will go on sale, so unless you're part of a group chat tracking it, or have connections to the centre, you're unlikely to have the chance.

Pauline one of the staff was very kind with outdoor drinks and cake and we ended up staying longer! It's a place where time stands still.
I enjoyed the fact that there are several areas you can relax in, with plenty of teas and coffee. The food in our package was gorgeous.  Not a massive portion but tasty.

Hope to come back (by Irene Curley) | Review 4: None - Lovely hotel,  the spa is fantastic  the grounds are lovely.  The only thing that let it down for us was the evening meal. The starter came out luck warm verging on cold mains was the same . Rooms were very nice could do with new pillows though. (by Gary Mc Cullagh) | Review 5: None - Farnham Estate are absolutely exceptional when it comes to organising weddings. My wife and I thought the setup was brilliant: the huge function room, the outdoor wedding area, the spa, the sheer amount of rooms and houses available on site - fantastic. What will always stick with me though is just how good the staff are. The team at Farnham seriously know how to do weddings and work incredibly hard to make your big day as memorable as possible! A huge thanks to everyone in the team, with particular shoutout to Margaret, Rachel, Cainon, Paddy and Emmanuel in the Cellar Bar. You won't regret booking Farnham for your big day! (by Andrew Bond) | Review 6: None - I stayed at the Farnham Estate Hotel recently to celebrate my mother‚Äôs 64th birthday, and while the hotel itself is beautiful, what truly made the experience memorable was the outstanding service from Bernie.

I had to leave very early in the morning for work and knew I would miss breakfast. When I mentioned this to Bernie, she immediately went down to reception to ensure that breakfast would be ready for me at 6:30am when I was leaving. But she didn‚Äôt stop there. She also went to the kitchen herself and prepared a packed lunch for me to take on my journey, and even provided me with a takeaway coffee cup so I could make myself a coffee before heading off.

This level of thoughtfulness and care went above and beyond anything I expected. Bernie turned what could have been a stressful early morning into a smooth, warm experience. She truly represents the very best of Farnham Estate‚Äôs hospitality.

I only wish I had cash on me at the time to give her the tip she so thoroughly deserved. Bernie made my stay extra special, and I cannot thank her enough for her kindness and professionalism. (by Sean Kirwan) | Review 7: None - Fantastic location. The pool and scenery are fantastic. This is our 5th time staying at the hotel. We normally love staying here  but the cons out weighted the pros on this  trip. The menu wasn't great in either maxwell grill or central restaurant which is unusual normally we love the food. I ended up ordering 2 starters and didn't eat much of either in cedars.  My husband had steak and it was excellent. Both nights the bar and restaurants were very under staffed. Breakfast on day two there was two male supervisors and the service was a million times better. Our room was not made up after the first night. The barman was very rude to us when we tried to get drinks after our dinner. Although there is beautiful scenery I dont think we will be back. (by eva mccloskey) | Review 8: None - This place is absolutely flawless.

From the minute you arrive it's perfect. The music playing and smells relaxs you instantly. Check in/out was a breeze.

The rooms are beautiful, comfortable, and absolutely spotless.

You could spend hours in the spa in the pool and multiple terminal suites. The beautiful scenery and walking routes are another great way to totally switch off.

We had dinner in an on-site restaurant, Maxwells. The food was divine, and our server Bernie was one of the highlights of our stay. Every single staff member was so welcoming!

We arrived on Paddy's Day and enjoyed some music in the Cellar Bar, which is a really cool bar.

Will definitely be back. Best hotel in the country! (by Nathan Doyle) | Review 9: None - Excluding the restaurants and the food, it's mid; the food is exceptional. Sticky floors, floors that haven't been vacuumed, old, rusty plumbing, chips and cracks everywhere on walls, dusty windowsills, odd practices. It's affordable nearly posh if that makes sense. The staff are extremely friendly and well-mannered, they know their stuff and are willing to make your life easier. (by Micz) | Review 10: None - We had a lovely stay here recently , very nice rooms (they were quite warm, no aircon , but we got a fan from reception which helped)

Staff were all incredibly nice and helpful, one bar servicing the whole hotel left for some longer wait times for drinks but still nothing major .

Food in the restaurants was very nice , some odd menu options but the mains were all great, particularly in the steak restaurant.

The breakfast buffet was amazing, probably the best selection I've had in a hotel stay in Ireland , fresh, good quality food from cooked, cold and dry options.

The spa is amazing , the pool , indoor and out is so relaxing , the grounds are also beautiful , lots of great trails to walk

7 Oaks Cafe,Cavan,"75 Main St, Townparks, Cavan, H12 T9F7, Ireland",Cafe,4.4,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 5 stars - Definitely a one of a kind spot!

The decor is boujee and beautiful! There is always a warm and welcoming atmosphere!! Especially with babies which can be super hard to find !!

The amount of time and passion that goes into everything from the art on the coffee to the aesthetics of the food to the wonderful flavours is second to none!!

There is a fabulous range on the menu! The selection of platters offered is amazing if you love to try different things and expand your palette. The first one we had was the dessert platter and there was a fantastic variety and the tastes were out of this world.

The customer service has always been top tier. The team are always so helpful and accommodating with everything!

I absolutely love going in because there  is always such a relief in knowing even with fussy children they eat very well . (by Aoife Leonard) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - 7 Oaks Caf√© and Wine Bar in Cavan offers a warm and modern dining experience, blending comfort with local charm. It serves as a useful venue for coffee, meals, wine, and social events, welcoming both locals and visitors. Considering it has not been opened too long they are doing an excellent job and are a terrific addition to the town of Cavan.
Modern and rustic design with cozy lighting and comfortable seating. Tasty sandwiches, soups, and salads, with vegetarian and vegan choices. The wine list is paired with Mediterranean-inspired small plates and sharing platters. Serving warm dishes like pancakes and toasted sandwiches, to pizzas and tacos.
Attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly staff from a family run business. Great recent event from the Ambient Music Showcase with three local artists. Full to capacity upstairs including the smoking area balcony.
The caf√© is found on Main Street, with parking available on the street and nearby at the Breffni Inn and access to public transport within two minutes‚Äô walk. The premises is wheelchair accessible, catering to both casual and special-occasion visits. Pricing is both reasonable and affordable and is designed to attract regular custom. This will be my meeting point when in Cavan town visiting friends. (by John Michael Murphy) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Good vibes, great coffee, and incredible food.

The atmosphere is electric and it is a joy to visit relax and enjoy.  The food is freshly prepared and you can taste it in the flavours that hit your palette.  My favourite is the bbq pulled pork but I also love the pizzas loaded fries and the sourdough sandwiches and to wrap it off a beautiful in house made pink lemonade and if you have room after the pastries and Italian ice cream are to die for.  A visit is a must and you will keep going back!  Thanks guys for always making us feel welcome and giving us an amazing experience.

But my chicken pesto sandwich didn‚Äôt meet any of my expectations (from bread which didn‚Äôt look or taste like sourdough, to chicken which was so salty and just plain at the same time), also we were waiting for our orders too long and the coffee wasn‚Äôt hot, though we asked for extra hot.

Chilli Lounge,Cavan,"CHILLI LOUNGE, 32 Main St, Townparks, Cavan, H12 E7D4, Ireland",Modern Indian restaurant,4.7,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Super friendly staff, vegan friendly food without compromising authenticity or quality.   Fantastic price point, we called in that day to book a table and staff were very accommodating considering the busy valentines weekend.

After a disastrous and disappointing Valentines dinner at lakeside manor, the food we were served here pales in comparison. Absolutely stunning food! We ordered everything to be vegan/vegetarian and they did not disappoint. No hidden shortcuts, food was cooked from fresh and separate from meat cooked dishes (very important as if it was cooked in the same pots and pans of meat cooked dishes, the flavour of meat would have poured into the food). We were even offered a complimentary dish which was absolutely delicious and very much appreciated. Hats off to the chef and waiters. We will definitely return again and will recommend to all.

Only downside was, we didn‚Äôt have enough space for all the food and felt a bit cramped, but the food speaks for itself so, this minor negative vanishes into the background because before we knew it, all the food was gone and we were very happy. We will definitely return!

3 sides, 2 mains +1 complimentary. Fantastic service, wait time was excellent and the same goes for the price. (by Arvin Coloma) [6 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - I had an amazing experience dining at this Indian restaurant. I made a reservation on the same day and was promptly seated upon arrival. The menu was extensive with options ranging from hot to mild to creamy dishes. I decided to try the chilli masala and it was hands down the best I have ever had in the last 10 years.

The service was impeccable, with the staff always wearing a smile and ready to assist with any requests. The food was outstanding in both taste and presentation. The customer service was top-notch and the atmosphere of the restaurant was inviting and pleasant. Additionally, the restaurant was very clean which added to the overall positive experience.

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious Indian cuisine served with exceptional customer service. I will definitely be returning in the future. (by Mark Smith) [a year ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - Hi there,
I wanted to share my experience from my recent visit to Chilli Lounge Restaurant. This was my second time visiting the restaurant and unfortunately, the food this time was really not up to par compared to my first visit. There was a mix-up with my order and the plain Naan bread I received was not cooked well. However, after bringing this to the attention of the staff, they promptly replaced it with a perfectly cooked Naan bread.

I must say, I was impressed by the way the staff handled the situation and their excellent customer service. The ambiance of the restaurant was extraordinary and I particularly enjoyed the complementary dishes that were served.

What really stood out for me was the small surprise they gave us for our engagement anniversary - a cake and a song. It was truly heart touching and made our evening even more special.
Overall, while there were some hiccups with the food, the exceptional service and thoughtful gestures from the staff definitely made up for it. (by Jonisha Joe) [a year ago] | Review 4: 1 star - We called a day before our visit from Dublin to confirm that we wanted the smoky dry ice effect for a birthday celebration, as seen on your Instagram. You assured us it would be done, and we requested a cake to record for the occasion, to which you agreed.

We traveled 2.5 hours to your restaurant. Upon arrival, we were told the smoky effect wasn't available due to a delivery issue. Despite our prior confirmation, you claimed it was a miscommunication.

We ordered 1 starter, a bottle of wine, 3 curries, and 3 naan breads,  got a complimentary slice of cake to celebrate the birthday. Out of the three curries, one was incorrect, so we asked you to replace it.

Your edited response to our review incorrectly blamed us for improper ordering. The food was extremely oily and not authentic Indian, as I know from being from Delhi and dining at many places in Ireland. While we were eating, you asked how the food was, and we told you it was oily. You replied, ""I am sorry, it‚Äôs busy, maybe that‚Äôs why,"" and offered us alcohol on the house to compensate, which we declined since we already had our bottle of wine.

We paid 66 euros in your restaurant, so don‚Äôt lie by saying we ordered only 1 or 2 things. Thank God we have proof to show, otherwise your fake comment could turn the tables and make it look like we lied.

We didn‚Äôt enjoy our dinner but didn‚Äôt want to be rude because we were there to celebrate, not to fight. As customers, it‚Äôs our right to leave an honest review, so stop messaging us asking to remove it. We didn‚Äôt say anything to your face because you apologized, but it didn‚Äôt make up for the ruined birthday night.

You gave us a complimentary starter due to the unavailability of the dry ice effect, but it didn‚Äôt improve the experience.

The service was poor, and your response to our review was dishonest. We appreciated the gesture, but the overall service and food quality were disappointing. Stop editing your comments to shift the blame onto customers.

We are replying to your fake and wrong comment which you edited two days later, thinking we wouldn‚Äôt notice. Be honest about your mistakes and improve your food quality and service.

Attaching the pics of what we exactly ordered so that people know how smartly you lied.

We don‚Äôt want to keep posting bad reviews, so kindly appreciate customer feedback and be apologetic for your mistakes. Thanks. We won‚Äôt be ever visiting again. Bye.

(by FH) [a month ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - We had an incredible night at Chilli Lounge with our party of 4! The ambiance was fantastic, setting the tone for a wonderful evening. The food was absolutely delicious - the biryani was flavorful and mouth-watering, and the naan was incredibly soft. But what truly made our experience stand out was the amazing service. The team at Chilli Lounge were so kind, caring, and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed throughout the night.

If you're looking for authentic and delicious Indian food in Cavan, look no further than Chilli Lounge. We had a fantastic time and can't wait to come back! The staff's warm hospitality and the restaurant's cozy atmosphere make it the perfect spot for a night out with friends or family. Highly recommend! 5/5 stars. (by Saifa Naseer) [a month ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Don‚Äôt be shied away by the entryway. Inside is an exquisite array of dishes to satisfy your culinary curiosity.

Chilli Lounge is at the top of my list for Indian food! We ate there Sunday for the second time and my meal was just as fantastic as the first visit. The service issue the first day must‚Äôve been a fluke because Sunday they were on top of everything.

I ordered LAMB BALTI and it was perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth, buttery smooth and oh so flavorful! Their Naan with garlic and cilantro is well seasoned. They don‚Äôt skimp on the real garlic.

Finishing the meal with sorbet is a delightful treat. Smooth, crisp, tropical with a hint of citrus. It freshens the palate and sends you off feeling refreshed and sated but not overly full.

I can‚Äôt recommend Cilli Lounge enough.

Thanks to everyone for an unforgettable experience! (by Bastable-Warren Irish-Dancers) | Review 9: None - A Culinary Experience Worth the Journey and the wait!

From the moment we stepped into MacNean House & Restaurant in Blacklion, it was clear we were in for something special. The ambiance struck a beautiful balance between refined and welcoming‚Äîluxurious without being stuffy. Crisp white table linen, tasteful decor, and a quietly elegant dining room set the tone for the evening.

We opted for the tasting menu with wine pairing, and from the very first mouthful, the flavors absolutely popped. Each course was a masterclass in precision, creativity, and balance. Dishes were beautifully presented on elegant tableware, enhancing the visual and sensory experience. The wine pairings were thoughtfully curated and elevated each dish without overwhelming it.

Before and after dinner, we enjoyed a cocktail in the beautiful outdoor seating area‚Äîa serene and stylish space that allowed us to relax and truly savour the evening. It was the perfect way to ease into the meal and to wind down afterward, extending our stay in the most delightful way.

What truly tied the evening together, though, was the impeccable service. The staff were warm, friendly, and clearly very well trained‚Äîknowledgeable about each course and wine pairing, and attentive without being intrusive. Their professionalism and genuine enthusiasm created an atmosphere that was both polished and personal.

A standout moment was when Neven Maguire himself took the time to greet guests at their tables. That personal touch made the evening feel even more special and reinforced the care and heart behind everything at MacNean House.

MacNean House doesn‚Äôt just serve food; it delivers an experience. From start to finish, it was ""wow"" after ""wow."" If you're looking for a place that treats dining as an art form‚Äîwhere every detail, from flavors to flatware, is curated with care‚Äîthis is it.

Extremely Disappointed ‚Äî Unwelcoming, Unprepared, and Overpriced

Our experience at this restaurant was nothing short of frustrating. From the moment we walked in, it was clear they were not ready ‚Äî tables weren‚Äôt set, service was disorganized, and it felt like we were an inconvenience rather than valued guests.

Even worse, it was made quite obvious that children were not welcome. Subtle hints and cold glances turned into a noticeably dismissive attitude, making our family feel out of place and unwelcome. If kids aren‚Äôt allowed or wanted, that should be clearly stated upfront ‚Äî not implied through rudeness.

As for the food: shockingly small portions, especially given the outrageous prices. We left hungry and irritated, wondering how this place justifies its reputation. Quality cannot excuse a lack of hospitality, unpreparedness, and a complete disregard for the customer experience.

Not coming back ‚Äî and I would advise others, especially families, to steer clear.

Food took well over an hour to arrive. Just tasted awful in general. Even heated it up and was still cold and horrible. Curry sauce brutalised with grease. If you told me it was poison I would most certainly believe you. Overall a horrible experience that has left me scarred, the food was horrible and the wait was horrible. I threw it in the bin, best place for it to go.
Bryan Sipak (by Jop Lop) [a year ago] | Review 8: 1 star - Only giving 1 star because zero isn't an option. Had the chicken tikka kebab and it was reheated dry chicken that was unedbile. The taco chips used dried lamb powder it was awful. The wait was over an hour for this absolute muck of a meal. Doner kebab was rank. The photos of the food are a lie and the people running the place aren't interested in serving good produce. (by Brigid Mulligan) [a year ago] | Review 9: 1 star - Absolutely shocking service from start to finish. Went in yesterday evening and was placing our order when the phone rang. The server then took the phone call and left us standing and was on the phone for a good 5 mins. Then continued with our order (4 meal deals and a burger) waiting for our food it took over half an hour, and I counted at least 10 customers come in, order after us and get their food quickly. After I asked how much longer, he laughed and said they were busy. Cans come with the meal deals and he tried to short change me a can too. When I pointed this out he said I had only ordered 3 and when I reeled out the 4 meal deals that came with cans he then went to check the receipt and only then gave me the 4th can. Terrible terrible service.
Only redeeming feature was the burgers were good. Chips were soggy (by Laura McMahon (Skeffs)) [Edited 3 years ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Ordered a mixed kebeb charged me 2 euro over the price on the board, next customer gets the kebab meal they only charge him 11 and his comes with a drink, seem to be charging what they want depending on the customer and I've always ordered out of here through just eat so they can't change the price I guess.

I highly recommend it! (by Kamile Jurgutyte) [2 years ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - If I could give more stars, I would. Dutchy's is such a fantastic facility, so welcoming and encouraging. All the trainers are highly knowledgeable and genuinely passionate about all aspects of fitness, but more importantly, they are all extremely approachable, which makes those first few weeks less daunting. Classes are only 45 minutes long and available at various times daily, so they are easy to slot in. Each class is different, which means it is never boring, and the trainers are always willing to adjust certain exercises to suit individual abilities so everyone can get the most out of their workout. I never thought I would enjoy working out, but with Dutchy's, I look forward to it. Since joining, it has had such a positive impact on all aspects of life that I would highly recommend it to anyone. If you are even half thinking about it, do it; you will not regret joining Dutchy's Fitness! (by Elaine O'Kane) [a year ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - I bought a 10 class card for Dutchys for ‚Ç¨70 and enjoyed it as it was something diffrent. The trainers Darren & Cormac are very good and trainings are intense.My only grievance was the constant social media posts everyday by the lady owner who was having/had a baby, some people just want to see motivational gym posts etc and it can be very hard watching other people talking about there babies etc if others are struggling to have there own and talking about how much weight one has lost when other people maybe not finsd it as easy to lose the weight. Maybe having her own private page to post walks with baby etc or a group page would be a better idea.
The platinum class can tend to be expensive at ‚Ç¨140/month for the two classes per week but you do get use of the circuit class side but people seem to be happy going to platinum as it holds 7/8 people per class while on the other side there is a circuit class for ‚Ç¨75/month and holds a max 20 people but only 8/9 people at my class. (by Sarah) [Edited a year ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - I have been with Dutchys Fitness for 10 months now. After having 2 kids, I was keen to get back into fitness & get back to ‚Äòme‚Äô.
Having moved from Dublin a few years back, I struggled to find the right gym that suited my needs. I came across Dutchys on social media and went on a trial with them. Safe to say I have never looked back. I signed up for the platinum weight classes (2xweek) and I have access to unlimited circuit classes.

The schedule is fantastic. They allow many options whether it‚Äôs morning or evening to suit everyone‚Äôs availability.
The apps are awesome too. You have 1 app to register for your classes and another to track your progress (calculate what weights you are lifting week on week)
I love the trainers. Each and every one of them are passionate about what they do and cater to all categories, whether you are a beginner or you are an advanced gym goer.
I love the people too. The platinum classes are limited to 6 or 8 so you really bond with the group and form friendships.

I feel so lucky to have Dutchy‚Äôs fitness and I continue to be excited about my fitness journey with them. Once you see results, you really become addicted üòÉ (by Amanda Murphy) [a year ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Fantastic gym!
I started going last summer and I hadn‚Äôt much knowledge of actually knowing what I should be doing. I started by doing the smaller group classes (platinum) twice a week. They taught me how to do the exercises correctly and encouraged me to add weight as I got the hang of the exercise.
As I got more used the gym I couldn‚Äôt wait to go back and started doing some of the circuit classes as well.
I have been a member of a lot of gyms and this is the first time I‚Äôve actually stuck to a plan and seen results.
Lorraine also helped me with the nutrition, by giving me guidelines on how to adapt my current diet to reach my goals. With the weekly check ins she is so encouraging and helping me with advice each week.
They have apps, WhatsApp groups, and regular emails all to help you with your journey and it‚Äôs completely up to you how much you want to do.
The whole team are so friendly and welcoming and always ready to support you. I would highly recommend Dutchys to everyone! (by Karen Henry) [a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - I joined Dutchy's 6 week program last December and haven't looked back since. The workouts are intense but that's exactly what you want to get good results. The classes are so diverse and all of the trainers are beyond helpful and friendly. With so many classes available each day its definitely worth joining, there's no where else in Cavan that offers anything similar. Definitely would recommend joining.

They were amazing, really helped me focus on strength and conditioning. If you are in Cavan for a week or more, it‚Äôs worth checking them out. Such a friendly, welcoming community and they are always on hand to answer any questions.

Very reasonably priced too. (by Margaret Forsyth) [a year ago] | Review 6: 1 star - I bought food from this restaurant on take out today (23/03/2020) using their online ordering service, and let me start off by saying that restaurants should notify customers, while ordering their food, that the items they want are out of stock, not after me driving 15 minutes to arrive at the place and been told that they do not have half the order in their kitchen. Secondly, in spite of my order not having what I wanted, they asked if i would like extra wings in my dish. When I arrived home, after nearly 45 minutes waiting to get my grub, I get home to find that the chips, are burnt to a crisp, alongside a scabby curry dip, and not very much meat in the munchy box (4 wings & 4 pieces of the sliced chicken). I went there on the recommendation of a friend after been told of the great service and nice food. It was my first time ordering the food, and it'll be the last. Very unimpressed. (by Glenn Matthews) [5 years ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Great for a Saturday night take away (by Ned Mac Samhrain) [6 months ago] | Review 8: 2 stars - I'm afraid to say that this is my second disappointing takeaway from Ko's in the space of a few months.  About 45 minutes after placing my order I was called by them to say that they wouldn't recommend what I had ordered and offering a substitute,  fair enough I thought, they informed me that the delivery would take an extra 45 mins. In fact it took over an hour, when delivered the food was lukewarm at best, the duck was fatty, stringy and cold, my partner couldn't eat it. My sichuan dish was tasty, but again tepid. The only extra they had thrown in for free, due to the extended wait, was an extra bag of prawn crackers, which we neither needed nor wanted. In summary a very dissatisfying meal. There are many Chinese takeaways in Cavan, Ko's need to look to their laurels.  I will not be using their service again.

The first time I went in, I was a bit disappointed that the online offers were not available in-store.However, on my second visit, the staff (different from the first time) was really friendly and helpful. They took the time to explain the different ingredients and even suggested some great offers. I must say, the pizza this time was really delicious compared to my first experience.
What impressed me the most was that I received my order within 10-15 minutes. The only downside was that I had to pay extra for the dip. Also, the street parking was a bit of a hassle, but I managed.

Managed to visit over the Easter weekend. Really loved their vibe and beautiful setup inside. Bar lounge was cozy and comfortable to sit in for a couple of drinks before dining.
Also bar staff took our dinner order from sitting so we were able to wait while having some drinks and go in when everything was ready.
Starters and desserts were highlights of the day.
Lamb pie and prawn filo pastry were delicate and scrumptious.
Both of our main dishes, which were fillet steak and duck were both overcooked, lacking of jus so it was a little dry but portion was huge.
Desserts were baked alaska and apple crumble. Both amazingly good and really sad that it was end of our meal.
Petit four was there but one macaron and one caramel biscuit to share between two so we had to bite into each of them which isn‚Äôt really elegant if you‚Äôre dining with someone else.
Overall, great experience and loved the foods, attentive staffs.

I sat down while my husband waited for the drinks and he heard the server say to her colleague that it should be extra hot. The colleague retorted ‚Äú I suppose she would want an Americano without water‚Äù and they all laughed. What disgusting childish behaviour and what difference to them how I like my hot chocolate? As it turns out, the drink was barely lukewarm and I barely drank any as it was so sickly sweet. I will never come here again. If you want staff to take the piss out of you then visit by all means.

"Farnham Estate Spa and Golf Resort, Cavan",Cavan,,,4.5,,,,,"Review 1: None - Farnham Estate is a beautiful estate, lovely surroundings and views. We were very kindly upgraded to a suite, staff very friendly and helpful. Spa is clean and tidy, outside pool is another level- beautiful views and nature. Food all homemade and full of flavour. Booked to return back for 3rd time. You will not be disappointed. (by Coastal597526) | Review 2: None - Another week, another wedding‚Ä¶ and this one ticked so many boxes for us. Great team, great venue!

We were videographers at Farnham Estate in Cavan and from the minute we arrived we were made to feel welcome. The place itself is stunning, but what really stood out was the staff.

Cainon was brilliant, nothing was a problem and always had things moving the right way. Katie made the best coffee of the day and kept us going when we needed it. Leeann was fantastic too, serving our food right when we needed that well-earned break, small things that make a huge difference on a long day like that.

The whole team were professional, friendly, and full of good energy. Everything flowed smooth, the couple were relaxed, and the guests were looked after from start to finish. The setting is perfect for filming, inside and out, with so much space and character.

Thanks again to everyone at Farnham Estate.so looking forward to our next one here!

Another lady looked on in horror and said she wasn‚Äôt expecting that !!!!
She said she should have been told !!!
We were NEVER told that this was going to be the case and she didn‚Äôt speak up because this was a treat for me and didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss , the man kept telling her to relax and she felt so uncomfortable throughout the whole treatment . So much so at one point she said she had to sit up as she felt she couldn‚Äôt breathe , she was that uncomfortable with the situation and how vulnerable she felt.

I wasn‚Äôt even given a robe on my arrival and had to change back into my clothes and was brought to a relaxation room fully dressed ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. the prices they charge and they can‚Äôt even provide a robe !!

When my friend went to pay for the treatments she was asked was everything ok and she said not really, she explained her situation and then that I wasn‚Äôt even given a robe etc they offered her 10% discount , seriously ????!!!!!!!!
What planet are you on that they thought 10% was suffice for this experience .
I was told she could have had a lady there, that there was one on stand by,
absolute rubbish !!

We were having lunch in the hotel afterwards so it‚Äôs not like
We were looking a freebie or chancing our arm, there was another hundred plus euro spent, I could tell how unhappy she was about the ordeal and I said sorry this simply isn‚Äôt good enough, i asked to speak to the manager of the spa and I explained the situation, I was told somebody would contact us as she was in a meeting , we waited and nobody contacted us .
We phoned back to be told by the lady on reception that she completely could understand at why we felt the way we did , this was a treat that simply turned into a very uneasy experience , something that was supposed to be relaxing and ended up being anything but !!!!
The lady on reception told us on the phone that regards to the Treatments that they have been told not to highlight that there is a possibility that it will be carried out by a man ! !!!! This is an absolute disgrace and disgusting that any female should be put in this situation , she also clarified that she took the booking off my friend and she was NOT told that it was going to be a man !!!

So the management was telling lies and making out she would have been told
When she made the booking -
NO SHE WAS NOT !!!

Still waiting on that call 6 weeks later !
The longest meeting ever !!!

It‚Äôs a case of take your money and say nothing and move on to the next poor customer that is led to believe that it is going to be a wonderful experience .

I will never be back !!!!!!!! (by Lisa Greaves) | Review 5: None - Really enjoyed my stay here. The room was lovely with plenty of space. The pool was heated which was handy because we visited in spring and the outdoor infinity part of it looks great. The spa treatments were also very enjoyable.

A little bit pricey but worth it if you want a few nights of luxury (by David) | Review 6: None - Beautiful hotel and grounds, we had a fantastic stay. We had a gorgeous view of the garden from our lovely room in the estate house part of the hotel. Food in Maxwell‚Äôs was top notch and all the staff were extremely attentive and pleasant. The staff in the Cellar Bar were fantastic, with special mention of Luke, who made delicious cocktails, taking time to do so with a flourish, and talked my partner through each of the drinks and really made it an experience. Even though there was a big wedding in the hotel the night we stayed, we still felt very well looked after. Would highly recommend, all round.

This is terribly poor customer service she could easily have served the 2 of us in the 5 mins left as it only take a few minutes to prepare the sandwich.

(by Michael Carmody) [7 years ago] | Review 7: 1 star - Attended a Christmas party in great form, looking  forward to it for weeks had no alcohol as I was driving... did have some food didn't get leaving the pub before severe cramps and diarrhoea beganü§¢ spent 3 days in bed weak from projectile vomiting couldn't even keep water down ü§Æ, coincidence? Who knows but when my son ordered a pint of Guinness and wasn't given change from ‚Ç¨20 gave the staff member a chance as there were one or two at the bar when she didn't show any sign of returning with his change reminded her and the owner/manager came over and gave my son 60 cents! It was eventually resolved but, who needs the hassle? Unfortunately, not the first time something like this happened as we were told at a previous event held here when 2 bottles of Champagne were requested for a toast that there was 2 choices ‚Ç¨25 bottle or ‚Ç¨50 bottle as we had a fixed budget we opted for two ‚Ç¨25 bottles but on paying the following day were informed by the owner, when he went to the cellar he only had the more expensive bottles and didn't want to interrupt us by telling us before opening them ü§î in my opinion this is not good business. I did give it another try but now I'm done.

I have went for breakfast there at peak times and sometimes there is only about 3-4 staff working ? You would think a big company would surely be able to hire more staff?

Arrived in Crossdoney at lunchtime. Family visited us and we just couldn't wait to go to the Shantully for dinner.  It was the obvious place to go.

The lovely young girl behind the bar remembered me.  A few minutes later, the Owner and his Wife came round to say hello.  We couldn't have got a warmer more friendly and humbling welcome.

All 4 of us ordered different meals and each of them were enjoyed.

We will definitely be back during our stay.  It is great to be back.

My Partner and I were visiting family in Cavan for 10 nights in 2 Airbnbs.  We went to the Shantully Inn most day/nights.  The food is fantastic.  Piping hot, excellent portions, great value for money and service was just second to none.  One night after the Virginia show, we stepped in at 8.45pm.  I asked if they were still saving food but the lovely young girl explained the Kitchen was shut.  The Owner stepped in.  15 minutes later, we were served 2 very hearty, piping hot, sumptuous meals.  You would not get this anywhere else and something we will not forget.  Such a lovely, humble couple.  I'm not surprised they are constantly busy and deservedly so.  No matter where we stay, we will ensure that Shantully is ""our local, our go-to"".  Your hospitality is applauded.  Special thanks must go to Caitlin.  Such a lovely young girl, an absolute credit to the team.  Nothing was ever too much trouble and service was consistent with a üòÉ Keep up the good work.

The desserts were very tasty,home homemade feel and great potion.

Overall its was totally a great experience. (by Shay) [a year ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - We are in town from the US to see our wedding venue (Cabra Castle). We came here for dinner tonight, the food was out of this world and the service was spectacular! We are definitely going to have to come back! The owner was so lovely and gave recommendations of things to do and a lovely chat! Overall 10/10!!! (by Kaitlynn McNeill) [a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - If you are near this pub and want an authentic Irish pub experience, this is it. We rolled in after exploring the area and were the only tourists in the place. A couple locals and the owner chatted us up like you'd hope for in an Irish pub.
We had fish n chips and it was the best of 3 times in Ireland. Light crispy breading and perfect flakey fish. Drinks and prices were far better than tourist cities.

The food is absolutely gorgeous but one thing that is a massive difference is when you order 2 meats, the bowl is packed out. When you order here whether it's one or two meats it's more or less the same sized portion. And for the extra price you expect more. Also the 2.50 for guacamole is fine but it's more a ration than a portion. Had tonight and food is still awesome but seems portions are getting smaller. The bowl was half full.

Salmon looked like it was freshly thawed and cooked that morning and reheated to order, slow roast was bland and underwhelming if im been completely honest. Very pricey for the quality of food served almost ‚Ç¨70 for 2 mains a glass of wine and a Heineken zero.

A pizza I ordered was Luso's chef special, taste was good overall, but a bit chewy (more crispy would nice), and toppings could be more as there were only a few pieces of toppings which comes down to the pricing which is slightly overpriced. If price slightly gets adjusted with the amount of toppings, 5 stars won't be out of reach. But overall, good.

Yeelong‚Äôs extensive range of food was able to easily accommodate some fussy eaters amongst the group. One of our party, who considers himself the pizza doyen of South, rated the Yeelong Margarita ‚Äúthe nicest pizza in Ulster‚Äù. The ‚Äòpasta guy‚Äô wasn‚Äôt disappointed either. However, it was the Chinese eaters amongst the group who were most vocal in their collective praise. A great feed!

Never eaten in, but always collected or had food delivered. Literally just rang them there, and whoever the man was on the phone answered in the most rude way, sounded extremely irritated at my call, sighed into the phone mic and told me they're not delivering because they're extremely busy. I had to ask if I had the correct number. Fair enough, that's fine, I know it must be a pain taking orders and such, but your own issues are not the callers fault. Generally, the staff are great, but you should change whoever the man is answering that phone this evening for your own benefit. (by A Mad Superhero) [2 years ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - This is a great takeaway with a wide range of food. The food on offer is well beyond just Chinese food. Burgers, Kebabs, Fish & Chips, and Pizzas.

Their pizzas are very tasty, with freshly made bases. The pizzas in Yeelong are much better than a lot of pizza places.

They also do a range of drinks, like Slushies, Shakes and a selection of Bubble Teas.

This would be my first time to try Bubble Tea. I can't think of another place in Cavan or the surrounding counties, where I could buy a Bubble Tea. If fact I have not come across another place serving Bubble Teas in Ireland, although there must be several.

There is something on the menu for everyone, even if Chinese food is not your thing. But, if its Chinese food that you are looking for, then you will not be disappointed with their menu, flavours, quality or portions. It has all the regular Chinese dishes, and more.

Yeelong is something of a new wave in Chinese, or indeed other takeaways, in that it does so much more than just the expected Chinese food.

The diversity of food offerings, could well be the future for takeaway restaurants. More choice, more variety, and even food and drink options you would not expect to find in a local takeaway.

If you visit Killeshandra (Cill na Se√°nr√°tha - The Church of the old ring-fort) and want a takeaway then this is the place to check out. (by Dermot Kelly) [2 years ago] | Review 5: 1 star - I have to agree with the previous reviewer the toilets are a disgrace. I‚Äôm not sure how this place can call itself a restaurant because there is one table in a waiting room! The bin was over flowing and there was a young child  running around like a lunatic. We ordered our food and watched as numerous people came and went before us. When we finally got our takeaway it was really poor. The chicken curry was frozen diced chicken and the sauce was tasteless, the chilli ribs were dry as a board and the crispy chicken sweet and sour was the worst I have ever tasted.
If there was an option to give it a minus score I would. (by Karyn L) [6 years ago] | Review 6: 1 star - If it was possible to give a no star rating I would have. Two people in the place waited 20 minutes for food to go then she tells me she forgot to put the order in. Bathrooms absolutely disgusting hadn't been cleaned in months when I mentioned this to her I was told toilets not for customers yet sign on door clearly states otherwise. Won't be back. Bad attitude . Chef in back clearly frustrated by her work ethic. (by Frank Connell) [7 years ago] | Review 7: 2 stars - Probably the worst food take away store I've ever visited.

The furniture, the toilets, the sofas, just everything was not nice and somehow improvised. The food was terrible.

The staff was neither friendly nor really helpful. We waited extremely long for our food.

St. Kyran's Restaurant,Cavan,,,4.5,,,,,"Review 1: None - We had our wedding reception in St Kyrans on June 29th 2024. We cannot express how over the moon we were with the service provided. Firstly the venue is absolutely beautiful. We live locally and were so happy to celebrate our wedding with amazing views of lough ramor as the backdrop.

We contacted Helena and Patrick about our wedding plans in May 2023 after getting engaged and from that moment onwards they could not have been more helpful. We had a BBQ style meal outside on the terrace and the sun shone down on all the guests as we took in the amazing views while we ate. We were absolutely blown away by the food and desserts served. As two foodies seeing everyone so satisfied with their meals was certainly one of the highlights of our night.  I cannot keep track of how many guests contacted me afterwards to compliment the quality of the food. It was absolutely outstanding and on a whole other level to other wedding venues in our opinion. The venue did an amazing job of catering for all of our guests with dietary requirements and made sure guests were never left without a topped up drink in their hand.

In the run up to the wedding Helena and Patrick helped us feel at ease by reassuring us that they had thought of every little detail. This meant we could relax on the day knowing our guests were taken care of. Some of our guests had cancelled flights the night before the wedding and arrived much later than planned. Helena went above and beyond for these guests stay up late to check them all in.

We highly recommend St Kyrans as a wedding or party venue. Helena and Patrick are clearly passionate about what they do and provide an exceptional service with a warm personal touch. (by itsgrainne) | Review 2: None - Enjoyable but expensive for afternoon tea... two of our three were missing a number of items - no apology when pointed out. Had to ask for coffee refill & one pot brought for 8 of us and waitress sighed when asked to bring another. She was not the only one forcing a smile when the bill arrived. Tip reflected the experience. Poor this time!! (by Patricia Boyle) | Review 3: None - Don't judge it by its exterior. The inside of the hotel/restaurant is magnificent.

Gorgeous interiors, lovely staff, but 100% the people in the next room will have the walking sound effect + room shake combo as the big stone fella from Mario 64 DS.

It's a sweet little bubble if you're intentionally seeking a no-thrills getaway.

My partner and I were intentionally looking for something very mild and isolated. It's a good area for coffee dates & the hotel bar (Percy French) is very nice. Lots of takeaways very close to the hotel if you fancy something fun to bring back to the hotel.

Overall I liked it a lot. There's something special about hotels that can invoke the feeling of a liminal space. The simplicity of it is great for spending time together without  distractions or buzz from the outside world.

Edit: my partner has pointed out that we can hear & feel when people are walking on the ground floor below us. I don't know how that's possible but upon further observation I can say this is true. (by A.V. Caomh√°nach) | Review 5: None - We could not fault the room and the hotel it's in a fabulous location, the only negative was the receptionist she was very unfriendly by no means a people person which is bad as it's your first impression but the bar staff and the breakfast staff this morning were warm friendly and helpful (by Leanne Corcoran) | Review 6: None - Lovely hotel.

Can‚Äôt sleep. Bass shaking the entire room. Called reception who said it‚Äôll be over shortly but that‚Äôs just the way it is when the restaurant/bar plays music. Not ideal when you have to work in the morning. Walls must be made of paper. Also the breakfast doesn‚Äôt start until 0900 which is great when you‚Äôve to be in work for 0800 and the ‚Äúcontinental‚Äù before that is cardboard toast, apples that were picked in 1997 and have more wrinkles than my nan and pan au chocolates wrapped in plastic you could wedge a door with.

The noodles that came with the chicken dish were cold, dry and stuck into one lump. It was obvious that they served cheap instant noodles which they cooked well in advance and just heated a little in the microwave. The side dish of garlic potatoes (not in the pictures) would have been delicious but the potatoes were undercooked. The duck was ok but too greasy and burnt quite badly on one side. Only the fish was delicious and nicely cooked. We couldn't eat the chicken, noodles or potatoes so they took them away and offered a replacement dish but we refused. At least we weren't charged for the chicken dish. We paid for the other dishes and left immediately. The whole dinner experience was ruined. The food was way too overpriced compared to its quality.

St. Kyran's Restaurant,Cavan,,,4.5,,,,,"Review 1: None - We had our wedding reception in St Kyrans on June 29th 2024. We cannot express how over the moon we were with the service provided. Firstly the venue is absolutely beautiful. We live locally and were so happy to celebrate our wedding with amazing views of lough ramor as the backdrop.

We contacted Helena and Patrick about our wedding plans in May 2023 after getting engaged and from that moment onwards they could not have been more helpful. We had a BBQ style meal outside on the terrace and the sun shone down on all the guests as we took in the amazing views while we ate. We were absolutely blown away by the food and desserts served. As two foodies seeing everyone so satisfied with their meals was certainly one of the highlights of our night.  I cannot keep track of how many guests contacted me afterwards to compliment the quality of the food. It was absolutely outstanding and on a whole other level to other wedding venues in our opinion. The venue did an amazing job of catering for all of our guests with dietary requirements and made sure guests were never left without a topped up drink in their hand.

In the run up to the wedding Helena and Patrick helped us feel at ease by reassuring us that they had thought of every little detail. This meant we could relax on the day knowing our guests were taken care of. Some of our guests had cancelled flights the night before the wedding and arrived much later than planned. Helena went above and beyond for these guests stay up late to check them all in.

We highly recommend St Kyrans as a wedding or party venue. Helena and Patrick are clearly passionate about what they do and provide an exceptional service with a warm personal touch. (by itsgrainne) | Review 2: None - Enjoyable but expensive for afternoon tea... two of our three were missing a number of items - no apology when pointed out.

Tip reflected the experience. Poor this time!! (by Patricia Boyle) | Review 3: None - Don't judge it by its exterior. The inside of the hotel/restaurant is magnificent.

(by John Moore) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 1 star - I ordered a pizza and a chicken tray, and unfortunately the experience was very disappointing. The pizza was slightly burned on the bottom while the top was cooked differently, and it was so unappetizing that I had to throw it away. The chicken tray was even worse ‚Äî it seemed to be made with leftover chicken, a few small potatoes, and large chunks of onion with a little sauce. The taste was unpleasant and the quality did not match the price at all.

Overall, I was shocked at how poor the food was, especially considering the cost. Definitely not worth it.

Also had the local craft beer - it‚Äôs from the nano brewery on site, you can‚Äôt get it anywhere else. As a beer connoisseur, one of the best lagers I‚Äôve tried in a long time!!

There was a stag in providing great entertainment but not rowdy and staff were very engaging with all customers throughout the time there.
Food was nice (risotto and chicken burger), chips/onion rings could do a with a little more cooking time. The local ale was sampled for good measure too. Would definitely recommend especially for the friendly staff. (by Karen Hopper) [2 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Really nice bar staff. Table service was a bit slow side upstairs compared to main area but lovely staffs even though it was busy dinner time.
Foods are really nice. We had bunch of starters to have it like tapas style. Recommend all seafood dishes. Smoked salmon was better than anywhere else.
Highly recommend their own brewed beers rather than getting other drinks.
We tried gold and black and they were really good. Wish they have the bottle so that we could take home.
We went there every day and twice a day while staying in Lisdoonvarna. (by Eunju) [3 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - I recently had great meal at Roadside Tavern. Guinness pie and quinoa burger was our choices, which was excellent. Pie shell was flaky and buttery, chunky meat pieces were so tender that melted in your mouth. The sauce for potato mash was excellent as well. Cauliflower and quinoa burger was so good, the patty was yummy and the sauces with crunch fresh lettuce and tomato slices were excellent. Onion rings and french fries came with blue cheese sauce, which was the best.
The staff was very helpful and friendly, patient with my indecisiveness as well. It was overall great experience. (by J P) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - This place is a must visit.

It was breaded when really you would expect it to be in a nice light batter especially in a coastal restaurant, it seemed more like frozen fish. The restaurant was incredibly loud so we couldn‚Äôt leave fast enough and when we went to pay the server actually made a point of directing us to where the tip was and to let us know it was for him and in a very pushy way, unsurprisingly after that he didn‚Äôt get one anyway.

(by Rosie van Heerde) [2 months ago] | Review 5: 1 star - Our first time since the new menu and new Chef
Wait time for meals: 40 to 50 minutes, mind you they weren‚Äôt very busy
Cost: Around $90
Our Order:
Scotch fillet, Medium Rare. Came over cooked on three occasions after being sent back.
Steak was like eating drywall and tasted as bland as their service.
The chips were very obviously re-fried multiple times and had chips from different batches based on how some were overcooked or undercooked.
The side of guacamole wasn‚Äôt even a guacamole (definition of guacamole: a dish of mashed avocado mixed with chopped onion, tomatoes, chilli peppers, and seasoning) instead we got mashed avocado with a jaw dropping amount of lemon

Wild Barramundi came over cooked, oily and dry all at the same time.

The side of truffle mash had no flavour of truffle or seasoning.

Waiting staff asked about the meal when taking our plates, and when I explained our experience, we were told I didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about and didn‚Äôt even listen to what we had to say, much rather just tried to start an argument. We were never rude and only spoke in a respectful manner.

I was so lucky I spotted this hotel on my way into Clare from Jamestown.  It's a pub on the main street. Right on a roundabout unfortunately so easy to miss when driving.

You could literally count the chips on the plate without moving them. 14 chips... and a tiny bit of meat. I felt scammed as I can get double that portion in limerick for a lower price.

Oar Restaurant & Rooms,Clare,,,4.9,,,,,"Review 1: None - The place was absolutely great ! The room was super clean, pretty with all the amenities you could expect. But what was the best was the person that welcomed us with great tips about the area and made us save about 30‚Ç¨ at the Cliff of Mohers & have an awesome time there with barely anyone around. It was magical and worthed waking up a bit early. Thanks a millions ! Hope we'll come back and try the food ! (by 3llie) | Review 2: None - We had a wonderful evening at The Oar in Doolin. The place is gorgeous, the wine list fantastic, and the food‚Ä¶ out of this world. Between the six of us we had nearly everything on the menu and loved it all. I had the summer salad, halibut and souffl√© - every bite was amazing. The staff couldn‚Äôt have been more attentive and friendly. Kieran came over to chat with us - he's warm and charming, and made the night even more memorable. He‚Äôs created something truly special here. (by Crist√≠n Duerinckx) | Review 3: None - The owner was lovely and the food was divine! We ordered the steak and the salmon. We were treated to fresh oysters as well. This was our 2nd Michelin Star dining experience (1st overseas) and it did not disappoint. Highly recommend! Worth the drive! (by Amy Shields) | Review 4: None - We recently returned for our second visit this year. First time was for the location, and outstanding accommodation.
But this time we just stayed to have dinner.

Absolutely FLAWLESS!!

Our only fault (if it could be a fault?l is that we were so full after two outstanding courses,  we had no room for dessert. A week later, I'm getting a terrible dose of ""FOMO"" (Fear of Missing Out).

A huge thank you to Kieran and your excellent staff, for looking after us so well.

See you soon. (by Tomas G. Kiely) | Review 5: None - Dined there last night - fantastic food and great staff. They even catered with some creative vegetarian dishes for us.

Highly recommended (by Mark Cunningham-Hill) | Review 6: None - Have eaten here on a few occasions. Kieran helps to set a relaxed atmosphere and Roxy was friendly, professional and mannerly.

The food is excellent. Whatever your taste it is catered for. If you are dining as a couple or as a larger group all are catered for. Whether the restaurant is full or empty on your visit, the standard is the same.

Highly recommended, excellent experience. (by Se√°n O'Riain) | Review 7: None - Beautiful little room with a view of the Cliffs of Moher. I did not realize the quality of the restaurant when I booked it and Kieran got us in due to a cancellation and we were blown away. The experience of booking this place and having dinner is truly one we‚Äôll remember for our entire lives. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat and book again if I‚Äôm ever in western Ireland again. But be smarter than me and book the restaurant in advance!! (by Natalie Osenbaugh) | Review 8: None - We celebrated a family members milestone birthday at Oar last night and couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience. Kieran and his team run an exceptional restaurant where every detail is clearly driven by passion and care. The food was fresh and outstanding (the salad starter is a must!), the service warm and attentive, and the atmosphere perfectly relaxed. It‚Äôs a place that values quality and genuinely cares about each guest‚Äôs experience. Oar fully deserves every award it‚Äôs received ‚Äì and then some. Highly recommended!

Go for the dinner..... simply amazing.... it sounds expensive but when you experience it you'll realise what a steal your getting.
Eat here several times now and so far haven't got a bad dish.

After waiting a very long time to have our order taken and then receive our food, it took 3 requests to receive a carafe of water for the table.

I highly recommend the ‚ÄòBuild a Brekkie‚Äô menu. It was great value for money. üçµ (by Shane Hancock) [7 months ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - Caf√© 1871 sits proudly on Clare‚Äôs main street, like a caf√© that knows it‚Äôs the place to be‚Äîand honestly, fair enough.

The breakfast? Solid. Eggs and bacon cooked just right‚Äîcrispy edges, fluffy insides, everything your hangover hoped for. But then there's The Sauce. Oh yes. A local hot sauce that clearly doubles as industrial paint stripper. It's as if Hades decided to grow his own chillies, wept into them, and bottled the result. One drop had me briefly reconsidering every life choice that led me to this plate.

To be clear: this is not your average ‚Äúooh, it‚Äôs a little spicy‚Äù situation. This is a tongue-melting, soul-evicting, ‚Äúdo I still have lips?‚Äù kind of heat. The locals treat it like a badge of honor. You? You have nothing to prove. Save your dignity. Keep your taste buds.

I also ordered a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù coffee. Now, in the city, that means an extra shot. In Clare, it means a bucket. Like, you could water a garden with it. Or bathe a small dog. That being said‚Äîit was Melbourne-level quality. Smooth, rich, no burnt aftertaste, and enough caffeine to give me Wi-Fi signal from the moon.

The service? Unbelievably efficient and charming. Like, ‚Äúhow do you remember all these orders and ask how my nan is?‚Äù kind of charming. Either they‚Äôre robots, or there‚Äôs some serious coffee-fueled wizardry happening behind the counter.

Pro tip: get there early or accept your fate in the queue of regret. This place is swarmed by locals for a reason.

(by Maria Dukhina) [a month ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - One of the best seafood restaurants have ever been to, highlight of the trip so far and would highly recommend for anyone staying in the area!
We had a mix of the seafood surprise menu (which is a surprise!) and the a la carte, all of which were excellent. Really well thought out flavours, and the seafood was all cooked to perfection.
Staff were very friendly and attentive.
Wonderful view, relaxed atmosphere and feels quite understated letting the food do all the talking. Thank you for a brilliant evening! (by Liddy Ellis) [a year ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Love this place, super food nice low key relaxed atmosphere great service from the friendly staff. Visited for my birthday with my wife, had a super experience, went for the surprise seafood menu and it was fantastic. Felt like I got looked after personally but the chiefs choices of course. All the food tasted great, excellent presentation and verified complementary flavours. Would recommend and will be going back as soon as I can. (by James White) [Edited a year ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - The food was nice but I had to order a side dish with my main dish otherwise I would be still hungry. It happened before when I order fish. The fish was small and had to order vegetables separately. I was still hungry after. The atmosphere and staff are nice. I think a bit over priced for what you are getting. That just me. (by benevolence smith) [a month ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - I have been thinking about this restaurant and its amazing Irish brown bread since coming here in 2018 with a tour group. So when my husband and I planned our Ireland trip for this year, I knew we had to go back. Our seafood surprise dinner did not disappoint! Each course was fabulous and delicious - our favorite meal of the whole trip. Love that the chef incorporates seasonal produce from the garden. The sunset view was spectacular as well! (As were the adorable neighbor cows!) The waiter who took our order suggested that we order sides as he said the portions were small, however we didn‚Äôt think sides were needed - the five courses felt appropriately sized to us. Service was slow between courses, so just allow time to not be in a rush. (by D. S.) [2 years ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Wonderful food, great service, incredible views.

Centrally located with a charming dynamic pub...make this place your home away from home when in Ireland. (by patricia delorey) | Review 6: None - We spent a week in Ennis earlier this month and stayed at the Old Ground.
Its location is perfect in town centre. Walkable distance from most attractions, including a lovely beauty salon just cross the road (Beautique).
The service is professional and friendly, at the reception and in the restaurant/bar. The poet's corner is great to relax after an excursion, to meet friend or to enjoy quality time with family. The food is good and good value.
My partner forgot a hanger with a jacket. We called the hotel reception, they took our details and a few days later, the jacket was home. The address tags on the packaging had been typed on a computer in big letters, telling a lot about their attention to detail.
The rooms are nice, very clean however, in our room the bathroom just had a big bathtub with a shower inside (working perfectly). We didn't mind but someone with limited mobility could find it hard to access the shower.
We were in the 229, room on O'Connell street. The night is calm but in the morning on week days a council cleaning car is beeping shortly after 8.
Last but not least, the staff includes a lovely cat very friendly with guests.

There were also radiators in both the bathroom and bedroom in case you needed some warmth, as well as a courtesy hairdryer, tabletop fan, and alarm clock.

Wehad our wedding at Carrygerry Country House in September 2024 , and it was everything we had hoped for and more. From the moment we first visited, we knew it was the right place‚Äîfull of charm, warmth, and character.

Gillian was simply outstanding. Her professionalism, calm nature, and incredible attention to detail made the entire planning process feel effortless. She was always available to answer questions, offer advice, and make sure every little detail was just right. On the day itself, she ensured everything ran like clockwork so we could truly relax and enjoy every moment.

The food was a real highlight. Chef Niall created a menu that was absolutely phenomenal‚Äîbeautifully presented, full of flavour, and made with the freshest ingredients. Our guests are still talking about how amazing the meal was, with many saying it was the best wedding food they‚Äôve ever had.

The venue itself is stunning, with a cosy, intimate atmosphere and beautiful views of the surrounding countryside. The staff were friendly, attentive, and genuinely cared about making the day special for us and our guests.

We honestly couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience. If you're looking for a wedding venue that combines elegance, exceptional service, and unforgettable food, Carrygerry Country House is the one. We‚Äôll be forever grateful to Gillian, Niall, and the entire team for making our day so perfect.

The scone that comes with the full Irish was delicious and we recommend eating it with the jam and the cream on top.

I visited recently and wasn't impressed. It has (apparently) changed from a pub into a cafe/restaurant but the layout inside is unchanged, with a bar in the front of the building.
I was seated at a table in the bar room, and ordered food and a drink. The room had a musty smell, and the floor was a bit sticky. It just wasn't very inviting. The staff were friendly enough but didn't engage in any conversation.
The food was underwhelming. Edible but not enjoyable. My Coke was almost flat and just cool, not chilled.
It was sad really. Keogh's used to be a lively pub serving good food, so it was really disappointing to see what it has become. It's a prime location in a major tourist attraction and there's not much competition in Kinvara unless you like seafood. It really should be a little gold mine... (by Simon James Dean) [a month ago] | Review 8: 2 stars - Struggling to understand the good reviews here. The chowder was watery and tasted like it was from a can. The fish was good but the peas were watery and tasted like they were also from a can. The salmon was definitely not fresh. The steak sandwich was decent but overpriced for what it was. Very basic, steak, mushroom and onions in a ciabatta with chips.

Service was slow and the food we waited so long for was well below par. It makes me believe some of the other reviews are not real.

Proceed with caution (by James Condon) [a month ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - This place serves the best food around. We both enjoyed the delicious cod meal with creamy mash and vegies.

The Locke Bar,Clare,"3 George's Quay, Englishtown, Limerick, V94 K8KX, Ireland",Gastropub,4.6,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 4 stars - This is a great spot to go for a local taste of Limerick. You can tell it's been around for a while and it's not too far from King John's Castle. We stopped in to get a small bite and found a cozy table inside. It's very pub-like but family friendly. The service was friendly and helped us to order since we were a little undecided. We ended up getting the Burata di Bufala, seafood chowder, and some chicken wings. Everything was about what you'd expect from a Sunday lunch menu at a pub. It didn't blow us away but it hit the spot and we got to soak in the Limerick atmosphere while we ate. I wish we could have come back in the evening to experience the more night-life version of this place because it seems very cool! Maybe we'll plan to do that next time we're in town. Sl√°inte!

pie. It was delicious. My partner had the special fish. It was cod with a spicy sauce, a salad and roast potatoes. Really flavoursome. Great selection of drinks, all the beers you could want.
The atmosphere was excellent. Irish music and dancing. Good tip if you want to eat on a Saturday evening, go fairly early or make a booking. By 8 o‚Äôclock, the place is bulging. (by Michael McInerheney) [2 weeks ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - The Locke Bar has plenty of seating both inside and outside. If you want to sit indoors with a view of the Irish dancing, I highly recommend making a reservation several days in advance, as they don‚Äôt accept bookings within 24 hours. They offer plenty of Irish beer on tap, which pairs perfectly with their dishes. I ordered the fish and chips, which came out hot, crunchy, and fresh. It was served with something green ‚Äî I thought it was mashed avocado, but it turned out to be mashed green peas, which was surprisingly good. The people were pleasant and welcoming, though the service was a bit slow. Prices are on the higher side. (by Yuki) [a month ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - We really enjoyed the hour we spent today on a wet, gray mid-September afternoon having a cuppa and a ham sandwich at the outside tables of Locke Bar. The tea was just as tea should be ‚Äî strong enough to trot a mouse across it, as the Irish used to day. And the sandwiches were well-made and generous.

In addition, the young woman who greeted us inside at the bar and took our order couldn't have been nicer, and the woman who brought our tea and sandwiches to us was equally cordial and smiling. The interior of Locke Bar is classic pub, dark, lots of beautiful woodwork, gleaming spigots for dispensing Guiness and other beers. Altogether a first-rate pub in the heart of Limerick's old city. (by William Lindsey) [2 weeks ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - The Locke is a great spot to relax with a few drinks lovely atmosphere and a nice place to sit by the river.

The food, however, was just okay. For the prices they charge, I expected something a bit more refined.

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the beef nachos‚Äîthey tasted off, and the cheese had a sour flavor that was quite unpleasant.

The staff are nice, the girl that served us was so nice and happy to help with what ever we wanted.

The bar was very busy so it was quite difficult to try get served, no real structure to the queue. (by Geoff Hassett) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - We got off the plane about 3 hours ago. First time to Ireland and this is the place we came to eat after traveling 17 hours. I ordered the Steak and Ale. My wife had the fish tacos and my son had the chicken burger. I didn't try the chicken burger. He inhaled that thing so it must've been good. My dinner was absolutely incredible. The mushy peas were really good, too. One of the best dishes I've ever had. My wife and son even ate some of mine. Her fish tacos were very good as well. Love the atmosphere and very friendly staff. Do not miss this restaurant! (by Bryan Hood) [6 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - The Liscannor chowder is excellent and my son really liked the cheese burger with caramelized red onion. Being able to sit outside beside the river is great on sunny days. The service was also friendly and efficient. If you are sitting inside I recommend getting a table in the old part of the pub (on the right) if possible. (by John Ryan) [a month ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - Food was better another time we recently went mid week when it was slower and I had family staying from America. We went for the music. Service was great and food was good too but I think it was better another time when it was busier. I had the steak and ale pie and family had the fish dinners and it was very good. (by Mantzy Vlogs) [a month ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - I stopped in for an early dinner and it was already busy. If you choose to sit outside, you have to tell the hostess which table you‚Äôre at so they know where to send the food. Inside though, a server comes to your table. I got a table inside and enjoyed the live music.

The cocktails were pricy, so I went with an IPA. The fish and chips were fantastic. The breading was perfect, the dipping sauce was the best tartar I‚Äôve ever had, and even the mushy peas were the best I‚Äôve ever had. I would definitely come here again for dinner, or late night beers with a group.

A beer and fish & chips cost $31/¬£22.85/‚Ç¨26.54 (by Lesley Longstreth) [2 months ago] | Review 10: 4 stars - Fish tacos and fries were good. The live music added a great atmosphere and made the evening enjoyable. However, we did have to wait quite a bit to be served. Overall, a solid spot for tasty food and lively Irish music.

Glas Restaurant,Clare,"Glas Restaurant Hotel, Rivervale, Doolin, Co. Clare, V95 DE2X, Ireland",Tapas restaurant,4.7,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - We booked Glas Restaurant for our rehearsal meal the evening before our wedding in Doolin. Our guest list for the evening was made up of 31 people which the restaurant accommodated without issue. We had a private room available to us and felt like the evening was relaxed and without pressure to hurry through things.

The food was EXCELLENT. As an international bride I had no ability to try the local restaurants in advance of our day and had to book everything hoping things would work out. Wow. Did things ever turn out. The menu was wonderful and accommodated our guests with food allergies/intolerances. The service staff were amazing to our group and very friendly.

I couldn‚Äôt have imagine a more perfect evening for the night before our wedding. Thank you to the Niahm for answering all of my emails (which was a lot) - you went above and beyond to make this happen for us. (by Pippa Girling) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - This was our favourite food experience in Doolin and one of our tastiest meals all year. The menu is focused around great quality produce, locally sourced, and at very reasonable prices. We opted for the vichyssoise and oysters to start and both were delicious. The monkfish and lamb mains were the show stoppers though - we wiped the plates clean with the leftover bread (which was another winner!) from the start of our meal. The servers were extremely friendly and attentive. Everything was 5*. It was a cut above any of the other dining experiences in Doolin. (by Barry Gallagher) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - TL;DR: good food, great service

I did a cliff walk from the Hags Head tower, along the Cliffs of Moher and into Doolin. By the time I arrived I was hungry and I wandered into Glas. It was a bit fancier than I expected, but I knew I didn't want pizza so I gave it a try. The room is beautifully decorated, with candlelit tables adding to the ambiance -- it would definitely be appropriate for a nice date night, but I was a dirty, tired solo traveler and they didn't mind at all when I asked for a table for one. I ordered the scallops and the mussels, both of which were sourced from the Galway Bay. The food was amazing and the bowl of mussels was huge. I also had one of their signature cocktails which I can't remember the name of but it was delicious. The staff were all polite and attentive.

The best thing about my dining experience there, however, was Nikolas the waiter, who told me that he recognized another solo traveler and made sure I was comfortable and had a bit of extra gin in my cocktail -- he could tell I needed it! When I left he sent me on my way with some warm bread that had just come out of the oven. I would have loved to stay and chat about travel some more but I had to rush to catch the bus -- and the fresh bread made the bus ride much more pleasant! If you want to have a nice date night come here, but if you're traveling and tired and hungry, DEFINITELY come here and ask for Nikolas.

The door opens into a clean, traditionally styled bar with a section of the open plan room reserved for dinning. We sat in the corner by the window and beside the fireplace. We sat, went through the menu and all decided to get 3 course dinners (why not!!). The staff took our order and without delay, we were served well presented and deliciously fresh food. Starting with mains, we got soup, brie and goats cheese. We enjoyed everything set out on the table. Next, the mains were bacon cabbage, fish and chips and turkey and ham. To finish, we got an apple crumble, Christmas pudding and tiramisu. We enjoyed every bite of everything and left feeling very satisfied.

I must admit, we did object to paying the separate prices of some dishes, but we can also say that the staff handled the situation very well and must be commended for their care and due diligence.

Portion sizes tiny for the prices charged. Chips not even like chips..more like potatoes thrown into the fryer and the bigger ones not even cooked properly..paid extra for a salad.

(by John Green) [2 weeks ago] | Review 8: 1 star - Despite its impressive 4.5 rating from last year, or so, this restaurant no longer lives up to the hype. The atmosphere felt off, with an oddly empty dining area that lacked warmth or energy. We waited nearly 50 minutes for three pizzas, only to be served something distinctly underwhelming‚Äîbland, poorly made, and far from what the rating promised. A disappointing experience that suggests the quality has slipped considerably since the great reviews were written or pictures have taken.

We ordered two entrees, roasted pork belly and special potato dumplings. Nice flavours.
Ordered two main dishes, gnocchi and roasted duck leg.

Overall, the portions are quite small. Most dishes were quite salty as well.

Desserts: hot cross bun w ice cream was okay. Worth a try.
Ordered Portugese tart for takeaway. The pastry skin doesn‚Äôt have nice butter smells. It was cold and so sweet, super expensive for a tiny small tart. $6.4 (plus surcharge). (by Rosaline H) [5 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - What a wonderful meal.

The service is also super nice and friendly and the pub itself is really beautiful. (by Pinewood Cat Lodge) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Try the gourmet steak burger with blue cheese. I wanted to lick the plate when I was finished it, but my friend told me that's inappropriate. The fries are good too, basically perfect. Furthermore, the pub has great service.

I was so full and the burger was amazing! My husband ordered dessert: death by chocolate brownie (of which I stole a generous amount) and it was delicious. Our friend ordered a mango ice cream and it was very refreshing (I tasted it too :) ) the view of the Burren was great even though it was raining. There was outdid seating with views as well which I imagine are lovely in a sunny day. We will be back for certain!

Highly recommend. (by Susan Drobysh) [6 years ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - THE wedding venue in the West of Ireland for an intimate event hosted by a professional family run team delivering the best of Irish produce, taste and the hospitality that Ireland is known for.

We had our wedding in August 2021 in Cassidys, Co. Clare with 90 guests. Approachable, professional, experienced and listeners to the customers ideas, Michelle, Robert and the entire Cassidys team made every minute of our wedding an unforgettable experience. Michelle was on hand to sound board ideas and we were safe in the knowledge that the advice comes from years of successful business in hospitality. Cassidy‚Äôs is a name and viewpoint we trust. The team have eye for detail and know what works.

Food served in buffet style was a major hit with our guests, allowing them to try and experience a range of locally sourced fresh produce. People loved this style. Michelle helped us pair wines to the menu and really helped us every step of the way. Different wedding guests have individually commented on their favourite dish of the day at our wedding‚Ä¶crab claws, sushi, the beef, the fish, the broccoli cashew nut roast‚Ä¶there was something delicious for every taste bud! Never left a glass empty and no guest left wanting.

Covid restrictions brought its obvious challenges to our special day. Cassidys worked with us to ensure our day was special while also safe for our guests.

The Burren backdrop, a unique and secluded location for a private event and a very high standard of food and drinks, Cassidys delivered everything we could have looked for in our wedding reception.
Working with a team like this made us feel very assured in the lead up to our big day. They knew our vision and delivered beyond our expectations.

We had so much fun and I think everyone did. Cassidy‚Äôs made it! While the sun didn‚Äôt stay out long enough to enjoy what the backdrop has to offer, simply view images to see how amazing this setting is.

We never once had to look over our shoulder to see if something could be done. The team were so impressive in their intuition and attentive nature to run a great wedding.

We plan to celebrate our 1st and future wedding anniversary‚Äôs in Cassidys to relive our special day made so memorable by this gem in the West of Ireland. We wish Amy and the team continued success in their future wedding events and ventures. It goes without saying that we would highly recommend Cassidy‚Äôs to any couple looking for a unique wedding reception venue.

Thank you for everything, Roisin & Will. (by Roisin Kelly) [3 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Absolutely fantastic restaurant. Amazing service, wonderful food and spectacular views.

The food itself was absolutely delicious ‚Äî starters and mains alike were top-notch, beautifully prepared, and full of flavor. Combine that with the very fair pricing and you get excellent value for money.

Nicest food in Kilkee. However when we were trying to leave (we understood we had our table for 2 hours) we struggled to find someone to get the bill from (for 5 mins) A waitress came over and asked us nicely to leave as she had another table coming in. We mentioned that we never got the bill and she apologised and left. 5 minutes later my grandfather goes up to the bar to pay the bill as still no sign of anyone dropping it to our table. After the bill is paid my grandfather returns to the table and briefly gathers his things (in his late 80s) before the manager comes over and asks us to leave again? Just left us with a sour taste in our mouths. I will of course be returning to naughtons as I have since I was a child with hopefully better communication between staff management and customers.

From the moment you step inside, the warmth of the welcoming staff and the cozy yet vibrant atmosphere set the tone for a fantastic dining experience. The food is nothing short of exceptional‚Äîeach dish is a perfect blend of local flavors and culinary creativity.

I opted for the fresh seafood platter, and it was a feast for both the eyes and the taste buds‚Äîabsolutely brimming with fresh, locally sourced delights. The portions were generous, and the presentation was artful. I also tried their renowned fish and chips, which were perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.

The service was impeccable. The team is attentive, friendly, and genuinely passionate about what they do. They made sure that we felt at home from start to finish, offering great recommendations and making sure we were well taken care of throughout our meal.

The ambiance is perfect for any occasion‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre on a romantic date, a family dinner, or a casual night out with friends, Naughton‚Äôs has the perfect vibe. They even have a great selection of craft beers and wines to complement your meal.

The inside is quaint. It has a colorful beachy vibe. There are a good amount of seats inside.

Staff:
Friendly considering how busy they were. We had no napkins and a gentlemen said he would bring some. He must have forgotten so I grabbed some from the counter. Near the end of the meal he must have remembered he forgot to bring napkins because he brought some by. Not a big deal because I know they were busy.

Ham & Garlic Pizza:
Pros: the pizza crust was good and the portion size of ham was generous.

Sourdough Chicken & Pesto Sandwich:
Really good homemade pesto sauce but the rest of the sandwich was average.

Not so good: the cheese and ham had no flavor. I asked for garlic and did not taste any garlic whatsoever. Either they used a very light amount of garlic powder or they forgot.

Water:
All the glasses were completely dirty, inside and out. Either they dunked washed the glasses or have a broken dishwasher because they were warm when brought out.

First of all, it is not a 4 star property. The check in was available only from 4-6pm, like it was some sort of Airbnb. Then the receptionist or owner woman was very rude all the time. The restaurant is not working, so all the nice photos we saw were misleading. We paid ‚Ç¨250 per night and breakfast was not included (in every hotel we stayed in Ireland breakfast was included within ‚Ç¨180-250 price range). Then the breakfast has to be booked for a specific time which was not convenient. The door to our room was not closing from the inside and there was loud noise every time someone in the property had a shower. The communal lounge had a bad smell. Also there was no kettle and tea/coffee in the room, which is not common for 4 start accommodation as well as for that price tag. Overall, the place looked empty and abandoned. But the biggest problem was the rudeness and the attitude of the receptionist/owner women. (by Victoria) | Review 8: None - Kate (the owner) and staff were lovely. Rooms had charm and were clean. Breakfast was great too! Do wish we had all day tea and coffee available. We also could not bring any outside food in. She and her staff were able to accommodate a family of 20~/10 rooms.

The food was absolutely delicious, with each dish beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that our celebration was perfect, and their attention to detail did not go unnoticed.

We had the St Tola's Goats Cheese Salad and Asian Style Spiced Pork Belly for starters - both were way too sweet. Why they chose to mix something pink and sweet INTO the cheese was beyond me. The end result are starters that offer no complex tastes but just an overwhelming sweetness.
For mains we had the Sirloin Steak and the Medallions of Pork Fillet. Both were fine and enjoyable on their own, though the weird hash brown served with the sirloin and the risotto served with the pork were bad.
The rhubarb tart was class though! (by B M) [a month ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Had a lovely dinner that was included with our stay in the hotel. Food exceeded our expectations.

I went to the pub and sat in the only place available at a counter right next to a band playing loud music. I waited for 10 minutes and the waiter never showed back up. The rest of the staff ignored me so I left and went down the street to Knox's pub where I was greeted as soon as I walked in the door.

You order cafeteria-style, starting with drink options available in the fridge as you walk in to your left.

There‚Äôs a nice selection of fresh salads, sandwiches, warm soups, and ready-to-eat hot meals that seem to rotate daily. Grab a tray and head to the line to order. When we arrived at 2 p.m. on a Saturday, the options included beef with Yorkshire pudding, fish and chips, and beef stew, all served with mashed potatoes and carrots. The sandwiches all appeared to be pared with a green salad and crisps (American potato chips).

We opted for a can of pale ale from a local brewery and the roast beef. The gravy was phenomenal! I enjoyed the Yorkshire pudding since this is typically unavailable in the USA. For those that don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs similar to a popover or bread.

Credit cards are accepted, and there‚Äôs plenty of seating upstairs, which makes it easy to enjoy our meal in a less crowded space. It was a nice stop to support local on our journey!

It also seems to be better managed, since the pastries selection is wider and is still offered by noon, in the past they used to run out of the best items by noon.

This is definitely the best bakery in Ennis, maybe in all of Clare county.
Extremely good bread and morning pastries. Their cinnamon knot is perfection. The focaccia sandwiches (I like the vegetarian and the vegan, they're excellent!) are recommended, so rustic and flavourful, though the ones I bought today were a bit drier than I remembered, whoever made them was a little cheap with the spreads.

There aren't a ton of gluten free options but they did their best to accommodate. The seafood chowder was absolutely amazing, and they even substituted gluten free bread. Others in our group got the smash burgers and they said they were fantastic.

We didn't stick around for music unfortunately but the band members were very fun during their setup. Highly recommended!

Additional:

We enjoyed ourselves enough that we went back for dinner again. It was less busy this time. Everything was fantastic again! We all enjoyed our meals and the staff was great! (by Jesse K) [Edited a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - We stopped at this restaurant during our road trip with no expectations‚Äîand were absolutely blown away. The service was incredibly fast; within five minutes of ordering, our food was on the table. The menu is simple, but every dish we tried exceeded our expectations.

The beef burger was bursting with flavor, and the Irish beef stew was the perfect way to warm up after our chilly journey. The goat cheese beet salad was one of the best I‚Äôve had during my entire stay in Ireland. My only wish? Slightly larger portions.

The calm, peaceful ambience made the experience even better. (by Sang R) [a month ago] | Review 3: 3 stars - Visited as a tourist couple. Lots of parking opposite the pub and spotted easily on the way into town. Nice decor inside, very authentic, a little dark since we were sat away from the windows, not an issue on the whole. Considering the majority of the reviews state that the service is 5 star, sadly, we didn't feel all too welcome. No hello or smile when we entered the building. Then when our drinks came, the staff member proceeded to throw the placemats on the table which was surprising and rude?! The food arrived soon after and it was amazing, we ordered fish and chips and massaman curry, couldn't fault anything on either dish. However, nobody came over to ask how we were doing and didn't offer any more drinks unfortunately. After we finished it was some time before staff took our plates, even though there was only us and one other table. we were considering a dessert but honestly didn't feel like it due to the poor service all round. Settled the bill at the bar, gentleman who took our payment was the most friendly and asked us how the food was and gave us a friendly smile. Think it was a one-off as the service is usually great from what the reviews say. Stomachs full but a little dissapointed on the whole. (by Noah Sage) [3 weeks ago] | Review 4: 3 stars - Three of us had dinner here on a Tuesday night when it‚Äôs half empty. The food tasted ok and the Guinness and treacle brown bread was delicious. Hands down the top among those we ate in Ireland. The restaurant is located 20 minutes outside Doolin facing the ocean. The indoor decor and outside view was very nice. However, the service was nonexistent at the best. After more than 10 minutes of waiting nobody came to offer us water or even gave us menu. After prompting we were given menu but still were not asked about what we would like to drink , while there were at least three girls standing at the bar doing nothing. The staff at least past our table half dozen times, but no one stopped by or offered us menu or drink and apparently they had noticed that our table was empty.
I don‚Äôt want to jump to conclusion but we were the only non Caucasian family in the restaurant.
We have been to at least a dozen European countries through the years and this is the fist time I noticed the correlation between our skin color and service.

Aug 7, 2025 update:
I want to thank the management team for the thoughtful and sincere apology and feedback. I am happy the Google review eco system is working as it‚Äôs intended and business is receptive to the feedback.
Because of this I am updating the overall rating and the service rating from one star to three star, because I believe the lack of service we received was an honest mistake.
I‚Äôd love to come back one day if I am visiting Fanore again. In fact we stayed in the village within the walking distance of the restaurant for three nights and would‚Äôve returned for the sake of the lovely brown bread alone. (by Yongmei Zhang) [Edited a month ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - We ended up in Fanore yesterday unexpectedly. I quickly rang ahead and a table was reserved outside so we could take our little dog. From the moment we arrived, a fantastic chap called Donal warmly welcomed us and looked after us so well. He was helpful and entertaining without even trying to be! The food was excellent, highly recommend the O'Donohue's seafood linguine.
The view from the outside seating at the front was spectacular. There was great buzz to the place. Big thanks to Donal for top class Irish hospitality.

(by Ricardo Moura) [a year ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - The dinner of roast chicken and bacon was lovely,staff were welcoming and attentive. The only thing I fault today was the dessert, I ordered the sticky toffee pudding, when it arrived, the cream was already all melted into the sauce which was very watery, the pudding was served way too hot so ice cream and cream had all melted before I could finish the pudding, all tasted lovely tho but the texture wasn't good. My husband ordered the brownie and same thing, the brownie itself was completely melted and was like glop, nothing like a brownie being honest (by Jade Eirinn O Connor) [2 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - This is my first time in Ireland and the pub feed this establishment presents makes me never want to leave the country.

What a view from the bedrooms. (by Fajon Construction) [a year ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - On way back to home we make stop to eat some food with kids. The food whose nice. Soup need to be more mixed for sure. Fish and chips very good. Lamb whose ok too. Staff very friendly. (by Pix360_adam) [7 years ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - Recommended for dinner, and 4 out of five were very happy. Waitress was friendly and busy as dealing with a birthday party in the function room too.  It has a very small menu but I'd recommend you  deffo go 4 the fish and chips. Massive portions and beautiful soft fish. Everything is piping hot. The only disappointment was the special of the day, a pepper chicken dish which had overcooked chicken covered in a poor effort of a pepper sauce. Almost no flavor at all from the dish. So 1 was disappointed and 4 happy ( kids had chicken nuggets and chips). It's a dining room in a pub, so grand for a casual night, but if you want a greater variety of menu or a very classy night out, this may not the place to dine.

Big recommendation. (by Philipp Sch√ºtz) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - This place was unbelievably good. As an american, the water was a bit strange, but everything else we had was superb, which included the meaty and special pizzas, the soup and the mango chicken salad.  This place is difficult to find, but very much worth the drive. It seems a bit slow for business which is sad because the public is wasting the value and potential of such a great gem, however, this does translate into the excellent service, making it more personal. This is by far the best food we've had in our two days in Ireland. (by John Dyer) [13 years ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Really wonderful experience.

Tried the Indian styled omelette w/sourdough, tasted so good!
Ordered Delhi burger, best burger we‚Äôve ever tried, the thick cut hot chips were so fresh and nice!

I will definitely visit Clare valley again and try more dishes in Antidote!

Thanks so much for brilliant food and services.  I would give 7/5. (by Rosaline H) [5 months ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - Lovely Cafe / Restaurant. The food was brilliant fresh and tasty. The staff couldn't do enough for you. Worth a try if you are in Clare.
We had Bacon & Eggs and Chilli Scramble Eggs. Delicious (by jenni willson) [2 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Simply the best Indian food
I‚Äôve had in recent memory - and I‚Äôve been to India about 5 times!  Superbly presented, fresh and with lovely texture.  The chef was very accommodating of my request for some vegan options, which shows their desire to look after their clientele.  I will be here for dinner every time I come to Clare now.  In the interim, I‚Äôll be envious of the locals.  Lucky buggers. (by Paul Bowyer) [5 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Such a great spot to start the day!
Absolutely loved it. We had breakfast outside in the sun. Generous portions, super chill vibes and friendly staff. You can feel the local love for this place. Highly recommended. Would definitely come back. (by Constanza Banchero) [5 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Everything we ordered was aesthetically pleasing to the eye and the physical senses, even the environment! We were blown away from the beauty and flavours of each dish, and how each drink was served and tasted. The best curry, the best coffee, and the best cocktails I have ever tasted!

Service was impeccable and professional. My family thank you all for making the experience memorable.

We wish this business longevity, success, and hope to visit again soon. (by Christine Liau) [8 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - What a pleasant environment!

The portion was very, very generous (not a complain üòÅ), the size was ideal for sharing. (by Vanessa Luvezuti) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - The pasta here was excellent. It was a nice change of pace from the standard Irish cuisine. The staff was friendly and got to talk to them a bit. A hidden gem and afterward took a nice stroll through town. (by Nicholas Rosen) [a year ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Amazing Italian food!  I come from a city with varying incredible Italian food from different regions in Italy.  When I came to Ireland people said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat the Italian - you‚Äôll be disappointed!‚Äù  This place is the exception.  It is run by Italian people who know their food.

We had the crostini (chefs choice) as our starter - terrific and distinct flavor combinations.  Highly recommend.  What‚Äôs better than the chef sharing what‚Äôs fresh and what‚Äôs best.  It allows for creativity.  We were well rewarded.  The simplest crostini was a fresh cherry tomato perfectly seasoned with salt and pepper on a fresh toasted crostini.  It was fresh, crisp, and lovely.  The most complex was a caramelized onion with cheese (Brie?).  Sweet, savory, perfect.  Everything in between was equally delightful.

Next we had the puttanesca.  It was amazing!  A perfect combination of flavorings with just the right amount of spice - and the anchovy did its job adding saltiness without fishy-ness.

We also had a special: the porcini ravioli with truffle cream sauce. If you love mushrooms, this dish is utter perfection.  Not too heavy.  Flavors that compliment each other.  I could eat this for days.

The dishes come with fresh bread and a nice little dish of fresh Parmesan.  So.  Good.  Just enough to make this a perfect Italian food adventure.

We ended with the homemade pastries with Nutella.  So tasty and a wonderful finish to dinner.  The staff did a great job recommending a dry wine for my wife that she loved and the one Italian beer on the menu was wonderful!

If you want a true Italian meal with a thoughtful and attentive crew, this is the place to eat. (by Roc Restaurant Roulette) [2 years ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - I arrived in this place by chance.

The nice lady recommended me her favourite dish (the green bean-pesto lasagna) which is not something I would have ordered by myself but it was the tastiest thing I‚Äôve had in Ireland yet (apologies to Irish fare!) It‚Äôs a small space with a couple of tables outside as well so I recommend reservations if you want to dine at a popular time. Passatempo is down a narrow alley in a quieter part of this very charming town.

Fish and scampi & chips was lovely.  My steak was great.  Of particular note was the griddled onion which I have never had an onion so nice.  Who would think I would be saying that!  The sharing platter for pudding was also lovely.  I am not nor ally a desert person, but each of the small portions was lovely.   Also the most important thing was that it was dog friendly inside and out.  Not like the pub along the road!!  100% recommend.

In the last couple of months, there's been a very steep decline in the quality of the food & ingredients unfortunately.

The potatoes have been rotten multiple times,
The gravy had an extremely weird taste,
The vegetables have been completely unseasoned every time we have ordered.

This has been the number one caf√© in town for multiple years but this decline in quality hasn't gone unnoticed. Please sort it out! We miss Caf√© Aroma.

The hollandaise sauce had way too much lemon in it and lack character. There were 5 potatoes edges in the plate (are you saving money on potatoes?) which made the dish look a little less enthusiastic. Coffee was really, really, but really horrible. Poor coffee machine maintenance or poor quality coffee? Here is a tip, coffee shop MUST at least serve good coffees, don't you agree? On the other hand, the apple pie was one of the best I ever had. Service was nice. Price really adequate. All in all, I might come back and try something else but it is not a place I would recommend right out of the bat.

If you really want that experience head to Silver Oak (their food is ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù and yum). I actually feel bad for others who enjoy food there thinking that‚Äôs the epitome of our cuisine.

Knappogue Castle Medieval Banquet,Clare,"Knappogue Castle and Walled Garden, Quin, Co. Clare, Ireland",Restaurant,4.7,,,,‚Ç¨70‚Äì80,"Review 1: 5 stars - A fantastic evening for three generations of my family. My elderly father has had three strokes and has extremely limited mobility, this event was perfect for him as well as hugely amusing our 12 and 14 year old daughters. Una and her team took wonderful care of my father, finding him seats, giving him a hand walking into dinner, seating him with easy access to the bathrooms and some support for his back, they were so thoughtful and kind, he had an absolute blast.

The setting is a dramatic 500 year old castle with lovely grounds, arrive around 15 minutes early to collect your tickets from the box office (you MUST pre-book), welcome drinks of mead or fruit juice are served in pottery cups in the ancient hall to violin and celtic harp music and you are welcomed to the evening by your host, the high king's butler, Tom. There is some fun with four couples being appointed king and queen of each of Ireland's ancient kingdoms and this adds a bit of drama to the evening and lifts the atmosphere. There were three big coach groups the night we visited but it is also great for family bookings like us who aren't in a group.

Guests then proceed into the banquet hall and sit on benches at long tables with a high table and a stage visible to all. Each course is served with entertainment and some fun role play, there is music, Irish dancing and traditional songs. There are large jugs of wine, water and juice on each table as well as platters of wheaten bread. The menu was local smoked salmon, a soup course, chicken with vegetables, fruit crumble and tea or coffee. The musicians and players in full costume serve the meal and it is lots of fun with plenty of audience participation. A great evening of Irish fun in a unique setting. Much more accessible than Bunratty as a venue. Not cheap but we felt it was very good value for the four course meal with unlimited drink and several hours of non-stop entertainment. The team clearly care about their guests and want to give everyone a memorable evening, highly recommended. (by Catherine Woods) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 2 stars - The ten staff members served as both servers and performers. They all sang very well, but the food was disappointing. They served a welcome drink, soup, ribs, chicken with vegetables, and cheesecake for dessert. The performers served the food, then performed songs in between courses. The food was tasteless; the best-tasting item was the cheesecake. We walked up 32 steps to a very small room, which was jam-packed with over 80 people. While we were walking up, we needed to hold on to the railing, and yet during dinner, they did not provide utensils, and was told that we had to eat with our hands, which were full of germs. I was expecting a grand castle to enjoy our dinner and a real show, but instead, we were jammed in like sardines. I wouldn‚Äôt call that a castle but more like a water tower.  I enjoyed the singing, but not the environment or the food. (by S L) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Amazing experience!

We absolutely loved our stay here, it was comfortable, clean, beautifully appointed rooms with everything you might need, wonderful staff.  The only downside was having to ring for fresh milk as they do not provide this in the room due to not wanting to use plastics, it was tough for them as on arrival we all wanted milk for our drinks!, but it would have been nice to have some available in the room's fridge.  But otherwise it was a perfect stay and a beautiful hotel. There was a wedding going on at the time but you wouldn't have known as it was quiet in the rooms and staff were all fully available.

If you love true Italian pizza this is where you need to go.   Don‚Äôt let the location keep you from going.  It is a bit out there‚Ä¶. But well worth the trip.  The garlic bread was amazing too.

The pizza is simply out of this world ‚Äì each one is a masterpiece of deliciousness with that ideal crispy-chewy crust and top-notch ingredients. Seriously, it's pure pizza perfection. Beyond the incredible food, the owners are absolute gems. They're so incredibly kind, friendly, and genuinely care about their customers. You feel instantly at home. This place isn't just about incredible food; it's about the wonderful people who run it. Highly, highly recommend! (by Max Marchenko) [4 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - It's most probably delicious, but make sure to reserve ahead! They have limited pizzas and they might all be sold out (reserved) before the place opens. So make sure to call in advance. Best a day before! (by Benjamin) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Finding Sa Domu has been a recent discovery nothing less than extraordinary. For us, it has truly become THE hidden gem of Ireland, not only for the food (which is absolutely divine), but also for the magical location, nestled among the gentle hills of Clare, and above all for the owners, (the beautiful Una and Giovannino) who are two of the most exquisite persons we have ever met.

The pizzas baked by Giovannino are simply a masterpiece: with a gorgeous cornicione (raised crust), perfectly baked, with the authentic taste of Italy in every single bite. Eating them outside while admiring the breathtaking view over the valley is an experience that goes far beyond just having dinner... it feels like being on holiday even if you're not.

And then, the pastries‚Ä¶ oh wowr, the pastries! The ciavattoni are unique, and the cannoli are something out of this world: hands down, the best Sicilian cannoli in Ireland (and I'm not saying this lightly, as we're really keen on cannoli!). So exceptional that, even after four days, they remain fragrant, crisp and delicious as if just made.
What makes Sa Domu so special is also the choice of real Italian ingredients, the impeccable cleanliness and hygiene of the place where Giovannino cooks, and the sense that eating here is nourishing not only your body, but also your mind and your soul.

We are grateful to have found this place, and it is now our absolute point of reference whenever we want to feel the beauty and the taste of true Italy in Ireland, with some chat with some of the loveliest people in this island.

The taste was outstanding! Very delicious, along with the great coffee choices and teas a culinary feast!

Well done guys - keep it up (by David Fenech) [a year ago] | Review 6: 1 star - Absolutely disgusting service, A Disappointing and Unacceptable Dining Experience.
My party of four recently visited your establishment hoping to enjoy a roast dinner. Unfortunately, what began as a simple meal turned into an incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience due to a complete lack of customer service.
After we ordered our meals, I inquired if roast potatoes were included with the roast. I was informed by our server that you had run out. While this was disappointing, what was truly shocking was the server's sarcastic response when I pointed out that it wasn't our fault. They said, ""Do you want to ask the chef?"" This sarcastic and unhelpful attitude was the first sign of a breakdown in communication.
When I requested to speak with a manager, a gentleman came over. I calmly explained the situation, and he said he would speak with the chef. However, before a resolution could be reached, a second manager (a woman) came to our table and immediately asked, ""What is the issue with us?"" I calmly explained the situation again, only for her to begin taking away our menus and telling us that if we didn't like it, we didn't have to eat there. She then accused us of being rude to her staff and ""causing a scene.""
I immediately pointed out that it was she who was causing a scene, as I had been speaking in a respectful and low tone. Her demeanor was hostile and confrontational, and it was clear from her voice that she was very angry. In an attempt to find a compromise, I suggested a complimentary plate of sweet potatoes. She completely ignored my reasonable request and simply walked away with our menus.
This entire interaction was handled with a shocking lack of professionalism and basic courtesy. The behavior of both the server and the second manager was completely unacceptable. The female manager, in particular, displayed no customer service or management skills whatsoever. Instead of trying to find a solution, she escalated the situation, made false accusations, and chose to be combative rather than helpful. She single-handedly turned a minor inconvenience into a situation that made us feel unwelcome and disrespected. We left your establishment feeling appalled by the behavior of your staff. We will not be returning and will be sharing our experience with others. (by Gurdev Singh) [a month ago] | Review 7: 1 star - Absolutely dead on a Friday night which is a pity as it's a great looking bar. Polite staff but terrible service. Seemed like they forgot we were there. Waited ages for drinks then food order.

Food was awful. Burger was dry and bland. Had to send steak back as it was just swimming in oil. Ended up not eating most of it. To be fair, manager took the steak off the bill which was the right thing to do.

We had a wonderful time and would love to visit again in the future. The food was incredible and we saw the staff gathering ingredients for the meal while we got ready for our meal in our camper van. Being tourists we were not comfortable driving at night so it was a wonderful surprise they allowed us to overnight in their lot and head out the next morning. (by Sue Ann) [3 days ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Homestead Cottage is a little gem hidden by the cliffs close to Doolin, Co. Clare. There is a beautiful garden right in front where they grow their own vegetables.

From the second we walked in, we were taken care of by the staff. They were very attentive, friendly and extremely professional. The decor is really beautiful. It does reflect the nature that surrounds the cottage.

We had a couple of cocktails and they were all really flavorful, both the alcoholic and non alcoholic ones.

The summer lunch tasting menu was delicious! Beautifully presented and colorful dishes. Every detail was thought through. The flavors blended so nicely together. You could taste the freshness in every dish. The kitchen was able to swap the ingredients according to our food preferences and allergies which we really appreciated.

We will come back to savour the dishes in other seasons too! (by Magda Chelstowska) [a month ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - We had an exceptional dining experience at Homestead Cottage. There were five of us. Two of our family have experience in food service and fine dining and we all agreed it was one of the best meals of our lives. The space is charming, there was a fire in the stove when we arrived, it feels like a home with warm wood, the stone fireplace wall, cookbooks lining the mantle. The service was excellent and attentive. The courses were well-paced and everything from placement and type of utensil (sometimes a small wooden spoon for example, sometimes a fine knife) were well paired with the food. The food itself was delightful and full of beauty and surprises, delicate but deep flavors and interesting textures. Gorgeous presentation. We loved our experience and would definitely come again! I enjoyed every bite! Favorites included the beef tartare, tender and flavorful oysters, scallop, the lamb (oh the lamb) and turbot and the peach and raspberry with Clare cream had such heightened fruit flavors it was incredible and the Valrhona Chocolate with shortbread was out of this world. The bite of the fruit square was perfect paired with an espresso to finish the meal. As you can see the presentation was a work of art but each piece contributed to the taste, the most important part of all. I wish I had saved the menu! (by Dominique Rychlik) [a month ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - There are certain dining experiences that will become memories to savour for a lifetime. Delightedly, Homestead Cottage provided this for us last night.

The experience began from the moment we drove onto the property. The austere landscape enfolded us as we tucked into the cozy of the 200 yr old cottage for our unhurried and blissful evening.

The serving team each present a beautiful energy and glow as they describe each course. Their joy and passion is evident. And they hustle, while maintaining a calm that sets an atmosphere for guests.

This is an experience to be enjoyed slowly. 3 hrs is the right amount of time for 8+courses. Savour each moment.

The courses themselves‚Äî no words can capture the flavours. It‚Äôs a journey that provides guests with a sampling of this coast‚Äôs best and finest bounty of the land and sea.

It was beauty displayed in countless intentional ways‚Äî from the petite dried floral arrangements on each table, to the musical selections (thank you for Norah Jones and Dolly Parton), to the hot towels to rinse off some of the rugged outdoor world we had just come from.

You will find yourself losing track of time (tuck your phone away as much as you can) and settle into Homestead Cottage to be a part of some of the magic of the Irish countryside. (by Sj Anderson) [a month ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - High expectations when booking the restaurant for birthday dinner. Little card message was cute and surprising as well. Enjoyed dining here but overall underwhelming and disappointed a little.

Booked whole trip to come and dine in the restaurant also visiting Aran islands was a plus. As it‚Äôs special occasion, wanted to add some drinks preferably pairing option so booked the separate taxi going and back from accommodation as well because it‚Äôs nowhere near town or walkable. However, it wasn‚Äôt worth that much in my opinion.

Usually staffs ask what we would like to drink and offer at the beginning but we felt left out, didn‚Äôt get asked and staffs all seem very busy. When they brought amuse bouche, managed to order wine pairings.

Maybe ordering drinks mixed up everything because we ended up waiting long to get the next dish and wines after.

Also, people came later than us getting food and drinks before us and our service got delayed more and more.

I understand that fine dining restaurant takes some time to get served and there was no hurry at all for us so didn‚Äôt make any complaints but it was noticeable getting slower for our table whole night. We were one of last tables leaving the restaurant after 3 hour dining. At that point, we rushed to get up.

Foods were nice - very fresh ingredients and seasonal. Highlights were main lamb dish but nothing else was memorably stood out.

Happy we tried but I don‚Äôt think I would recommend rather than amazing & affordable options in the area. (by Eunju) [2 months ago] | Review 6: 3 stars - We loved the cottage feel of this place.
The service was ok, it took till the middle of my second course to order and get my wine though. I didn‚Äôt always understand what the dish was because the server spoke very quickly.
Apart from the dessert, the bread course was our favourite.
Didn‚Äôt know what the menu would be and my hubby is not a seafood lover and didn‚Äôt eat the oysters which I ended up having both but were delicious. Second and third courses were also seafood but weren‚Äôt particularly great. The cod was steamed but could‚Äôve done with a little more cooking time for our tastes and contained bones which nearly pierced my throat. The crab was nice but lacked flavour.
The lamb dish was tasty but had too much fat for my taste.
The best bit about the meal was the dessert and the wine I had was very good.
All in all we paid over ‚Ç¨210, which we had driven 2 hours to get to for a meal that was really just ok. I would not go again. I just didn‚Äôt think it was that special.
We did love the fact the produce was locally sourced and that was remarkable.
We‚Äôve experienced Michelin accredited food before, however, this didn‚Äôt hit the mark for us.
Sorry. (by Anjli Wouhra-Cummings) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 3 stars - First off, food was incredible. Quality, variety, use of Irish ingredients, all well worthy of the star.

Sadly the service was really quite poor though. It took almost four hours to get through an eight course tasting menu (‚Ç¨125pp). Great welcome initially, but after that we spent about 90% of our time sitting in front of empty plates or an empty table. They would benefit from a more speedy service (I get 4h for a 15+ course menu, not for 8 though).

Also the setup of the cottage is quite interesting. We were in a room to the left when you enter (I'd avoid this one if you can, seems the other areas are better). There are three tables of two there, so super intimate. It also though feels like you're forgotten about by the staff, maybe because they can't actually see you. One time I went to try find a staff member to ask if it could go a bit quicker, I walked through all the rooms, and there wasn't one staff member outside the kitchen in any of the dining rooms. So no one keeping an eye on things. Also, could rarely understand their descriptions of plates (mainly starters and desserts), where it felt like they were trying to urgently get out the details before sprinting back to the kitchen. Maybe under-staffed?

Altogether, great food, huge amount to work on for service of a Michelin star though, so depending how much this matters to you should influence your decision to go. (by Graham Mills) [2 months ago] | Review 8: 2 stars - The food overall was very good ‚Äî beautiful use of high-quality Irish produce, clearly sourced with care. The atmosphere was lovely: warm, rustic, and inviting.

However, we were really let down by one dish in particular ‚Äî a crab course that contained several sharp pieces of shell. My partner had to remove 6 or 7 fragments from her mouth after biting down on them, which is not only unpleasant but quite dangerous. We showed the pieces to the waitress, who acknowledged the issue and said she‚Äôd inform the kitchen, but that was the last we heard of it. No apology, no follow-up, no gesture whatsoever.

For a restaurant of this reputation and price point (we paid over ‚Ç¨300 for the meal), we expected a far higher level of care and service. A shame, because it otherwise could have been a standout experience. (by Jonathan Kennedy) [3 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Homestead Cottage is a Michelin-starred restaurant for good reason‚Äîbut beyond the accolades, what truly sets it apart is the unhurried, welcoming dining experience they create.

The team, led by Sophie, made us feel right at home‚Äîeven with our 4-year-old dining alongside us. The staff was warm and attentive without ever making the meal feel rushed. And the food? Absolutely exceptional. They blend flavors with a level of finesse and creativity that few restaurants can match.

Plan ahead, make the reservation, and go. You will not be sorry. (by Brett Williamson) [3 months ago] | Review 10: 3 stars - We've thought long and hard about this review. We looked forward to our visit for so long. But we left disappointed and probably won't return. The food is excellent,  the room  quirky but it works. Some of tge tables are too tight, but when we moved one of our chairs, it was better. The problem was with the service and pricing. We didn't get the wine we ordered. Not a big deal. The replacement was fine but we were assured again and again it was the right one (it wasn't). When the bill cane it seemed high but we added a tip. Then after paying we discovered a service charge was already added. When we pointed this out and asked for one of the tips to be refunded there began a week long drama... eventually we got one of tge tips back but it left a sour taste after such delicious food. Chef needs to sort front of house.

First thing that was said to us by service was ""One minute"". No ""welcome in, just give me a moment and I'll be with you"". Not quite the welcome you want.

Had the soup, burger, and pepperoni pizza. The soup was excellent, but the pizza and burger were let downs. Pizza was overloaded with cheese and very little base sauce, the pepperoni also didnt taste great. Burger was very dry, but chips were good. Not worth the price for the quality we received.

Superb atmosphere. Excellent service. Don‚Äôt hesitate! (by Linguaviva Centre) [a month ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - We had a great last meal in limerick at this restaurant! The place inside is very cozy, too bad it was almost 80 degrees outside. Anyway, we ordered a bottle of prosecco and got the sour dough bread and bread which was amazing. I ordered the lamb shank with roasted potatoes. It was delicious with the meat falling off the bone. My daughter got the prawn linguini which was very good. My husband got the chicken which was delicious as well. We ended with the creme brulee which was yum. Overall it was a very nice experience!

The atmosphere was fabulous, the staff were warm and welcoming and the food was exceptional. As a vegetarian, I struggle to get anything that isn't a standard curry or thrown together stir fry, but the options at Freddys were amazing and the nut roast was by far the best veggie food I've ever eaten in Ireland. My friends, all non veggies, said their food was divine too. Would absolutely recommend to anybody and everybody.

The carvery dinners are huge, the fish and chips, burger, chicken goujons and chips and pizza are all tasty and good value.

Jilly and Joes is a welcoming and inclusive environment for all. (I stress this, as plenty of businesses claim inclusiveness, but it takes a exceptional staff to make a place actually feel inclusive.

The food was good, in a way you would expect from a walk up counter. (by Stacy WB) [a year ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Good and tasty food. Spicy boxes can be more spicy or to have the hot sauce or flakes to add if you want. The chicken burger looks like a kid's meal, but it's tasty.

This pub went above and beyond our expectations and hit the spot two nights in a row after hiking. From the fish and chips to the bangers and mash. Everything is wonderful.

Service was excellent and we were able to order our food quite quickly and it arrived without much of a wait.
Food was outstanding! There were 3 of us in our party and we all ordered something different - bangers and mash, Irish beef stew and vegetarian fajitas. The food was well presented, delicious and very reasonably priced.

What we received were pub+ quality meals served on plates with garnish. We had pasta (tasted incredible), pizzas (delicious), a schnitzel with gravy (fantastic taste, unfortunately the chips were old tasting), wedges and possibly the best garlic bread I've ever had. 4 meals plus sides came to just over $50. The staff clearly try hard to please although perhaps a little out of their depth. Only thing that would make it better is some wine but I don't reckon they have a liquor licence. Pretty stoked to go back next time we're in Clare. (by Adam P) [a year ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Amazing Food and Service

Unfortunately, a LOT of pizza sauce which was thick to the point of not being heated through. Wondering if we received the wrong order, as the base was meant to be bbq, but it was definitely tomato, and we couldn't identify any meat other than the ham and a couple of bits of mettwurst. There also wasn't much cheese. I won't be eating the leftovers. (The erratic variation between reviews seems to indicate there are two or more very different classed chefs/cooks preparing the food.)

Roma Take Away,Clare,"Market Square, Kilrush, Co. Clare, Ireland",Restaurant,4.3,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 3 stars - It was ok, on the google images it shows pizza with a nice char on the crust but mine was a bit limp and underdone. I asked for Salami but they put ham and when challenged they said ham is what they call Salami, so that‚Äôs a bit random. I wasn‚Äôt offered a replacement, which would be the appropriate customer service response, so they lost a star there. The toppings were kinda just dumped in the middle too, instead of evenly spread around and that‚Äôs a bit lazy. It‚Äôs a big place but no tables or chairs are offered. I had to return for napkins as they weren‚Äôt provided. They do not have shakers on the counter for chilli flakes, oregano, salt or pepper. They only accept cash and that is obviously inappropriate for a business and an inconvenience for the customer so that took another star. The pizza tasted ok apart from that ultra processed ham which I removed. I would probably go back but ask for the pizza to be well done and replace the salami (ham) with pepperoni. Overall I was disappointed but with just a little effort this could really be a great Pizza restaurant. Everyone working there was Eastern European and it somehow felt like it may have changed hands recently. They were fast to serve the food, the ingredients seemed fresh, they were friendly and the kitchen looked clean.  A bit of customer service training would help them to better understand the expectations customers have after handing over their hard earned money. To end, they offer good value for the overall quality of the food and the pizza dough itself is very good.

Couldn't get true by phone, so we ordered when we were there . Its a 20 minute drive to get there !
When we were there, no donner kebab, no philly steak sandwich !
So it was fish ,garlic chips and pizza !
Never had a bad experience but this day it was !
Garlic chip was garlic cheese ( not ordered)
Fish was fried to lo g and dry !
And the pizza for the children was totally burnt, black on the bottom  !

They couldn't eat it so made sandwich for them. It was the last day they were  here  before flying back home, and never been so disappointed! Ofcourse no reply when I tried to call them !
Were they so busy, overwhelmed?
No idea but to screw up such a big order is very bad !

There wasn't a huge choice of sweets or savoury items that one could expect in a busy town. The coffee is average, and the spinach and fetta roll I had was OK, but nothing special.

He looked, and said that he'd change it.  He brought me another of the same labling that he had opened for inspection. It was very similar to the first one, except that between us we did find a couple of tiny meat like pieces.

Our coffees were so weak‚Ä¶ like drinking dish water and having bought a pasty and pie for our lunch they were dry, small and totally tasteless. The table was dirty from previous customers. We took one bite each from our food and a sip of coffee to wash it down and got up and left 3/4 of what we paid for on the table. We then ventured to the local for a cheap tasty meal. (by ingrid santucci) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Have just re-discovered this wonderful bakery/cafe. Although now locals, we have avoided The Clare Bakehouse as it had been poorly run in the past. All that changed for us this afternoon.....We had the best oat-milk banana milkshake, carrot cake and hand- made iced coffee ever. The food and drinks were absolutely excellent. The very best thing about our visit today though, would have to be the staff! Tom and Tash are absolute treasures and these two people alone, will be the reason we intend to keep coming back. Wonderful manners and first class customer service. A real pleasure to meet such lovely people behind the counter. Keep up the good work you guys. Your kindness and your great personalities are very much loved and appreciated. (by Andy Applebee) [7 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Friendly bakery with plenty of choice to eatin or take away.

(by Temi A) [7 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - The most wonderful mocha and pizza I‚Äôve ever tasted. The customer service was very welcoming and the food was spectacular. (by Aniela) [4 months ago] | Review 7: 1 star - Firstly, the restaurant was near empty on arrival, but we were  told they only had ""tables for two people!"" which seemed very strange in a near empty restaurant! 6 people ahead of us were also refused a table in the empty restaurant and left ahead of us. Confused, at the ""Two People Only "" Policy,  I suggested to the waitress that we were prepared to wait for a table, there was myself and two kids. The only reason I can see for the ridiculous policy is that clearly they did not want to serve us the Cheaper Special Kids Menu, ironically we did not.want it either! Finally after waiting 15 Minutes outside on the Street in the rain,  we were offered a table inside in the near empty restaurant. The Food, medicore at best. The Goats cheese Salad was tasty but tiny. The Spicy Chicken Wings  were uncomfortably hot, to the extent they burnt your lips off. The piizza was a tad miserable and soggy. Our table next to the Toilet Entrance proved to be uncomfortable and dismal. .. We had to listen to a clearly incompetent manager continually barking at his staff who were doing their best while the manager himself done basically nothing. One poor girl was almost in tears because the manager in question wanted to send her home just after two hours work, and quite rightly, she refused to leave! Lowsey ... and probably illegal too!!  You could sense the stress and unease everywhere in the restaurant. Usually Milano's looks somewhat ""Classy "" and has a bit of ""Finesse"" But this Joker of a Manager is running it into the ground like some sort of Inner City Chipper! Messy piles of empty Pizza boxes stacked cahaottically  everywhere and more managers sitting on there butts next to us than customers, made for a ""Staff Canteen"" feel while  ""General Chow"" (Manager) continued to run around like a headless chicken and bark at his staff. The place was dis-organised, cluttered with empty pizza boxes, and crowded with waiting ""delivery boys"" waiting for their takeaways in the noisy canteen! It had no resemblance of the relaxing restaurant Milano's usually is. Case in point, Milano's at the Crescent Limerick- Excellent.  The Toilets were filthy and smelly too. Seeing hardworking lovely waiting staff treated so badly by their Manager really did leave a bitter taste in our mouths.... Awful shocking sh@#. (by True Review) [5 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - I was there with my family for a quick lunch on a Friday afternoon. The restaurant was nice and clean. We got a nice table in a corner as my son didn't want to sit in a centre of the restaurant. Staff was very nice and attentive. We got our drinks and starters fast and the pizza arrived very quickly too. Everything was nicely baked and served and super delicious. Special thanks to Ciara ( I hope I got the name right - blonde hair with glasses) that was serving us and also the other waitress that was on a shift (long black hair) for putting a super huge smile on my son's face with the desert. Thank you! (by Daniel Marchewka (Spreddo)) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Super service, Thibaut took care of us the most amazing way, he advised us well on the menu, including plentiful vegan options, was dynamic and smiley, he did the job 100%.
And the kitchen: really fresh and really good! Very large menu, everything we ordered was delicious. (by Thibaud Leboucq) [3 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - We are just after having a wonderful dinner at Milanos today.
I have to say it was a remarkable evening . My boyfriend (now fianc√©) proposed to me in there. The reason why he chose this restaurant was because it was the place where we had our first date, so it is a really special spot to us. From starters to dessert the food was amazing, one of the mains we had ordered was the smoky bbq chicken pizza and it was the highlight. Well done chef Jelchor. I would also like to leave here my high praises to the staff who was so helpful, we were just speechless‚Ä¶ Thanks to the Manager, Hemilea and the lovely waitress, Natalie, we had a great time.
Then at the end, when we went to pay the bill, we were shocked when they said it was on the house.
We are very thankful!!!

Russell's Fishshop,Clare,"Teergonean, Doolin, Co. Clare, V95 XR0K, Ireland",Fish & chips restaurant,4.5,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 2 stars - I am a frequent visitor to Doolin and I first ordered food from Russell‚Äôs in May 2025 after seeing some positive reviews on social media. I ordered their Fried Atlantic Prawn Scampi for take-out and selected a pickup time online through their website. My order was ready when I arrived to collect it and I went along my merry way back to where I was staying.
I was not disappointed by the quality of the food (which was good), but I was very disappointed with the quantity, there was just 6 pieces of Fried Atlantic Prawn Scampi in the box, 2 of which were extra small and a box full of chips. It felt like it was a very expensive box of chips.
I did provide Russell‚Äôs with this feedback online hoping for a response but I got no response from them - I prefer to offer negative feedback to business directly rather than having to submit public reviews. (by Fergus O'Shea) [3 weeks ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - An interesting place; we ate in the outside wooden pods as we had two dogs with us and interestingly each pod had a heating lamp above the table should you need it, which was considerate of the owners. The take-away menu was somewhat limited with only one type of fish (cod), a Berger, Sausage etc and one vegetarian dish based upon sweet potato.

The chips were crisp and were cooked in beef dripping but fortunately the effect was not overpowering as it can be with such cooking methods. The fish had a thin crisp batter and was not in any way oily which was good but the fish didn‚Äôt have the density of a typical freshly caught cod which was curious.

The dine in menu seemed much more developed so as a take-away experience I wouldn‚Äôt rush to return if I were in the area. (by Mal Jones) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - Always love the food in Russell's Fish shop. Decided to be adventurous & try something new so went for the chargrilled sweet potato. The dish was lovely but felt ‚Ç¨16 was very steep for 3 pieces of sweet potato ü´§ it's a side dish not a main, price should reflect that. (by Melanie O'Donoghue) [2 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Absolutely excellent. Great service,  excellent food. Brilliant prices. Highly recommend the fish and chips, and the onion rings. Indoor seating and outdoor seating with shelter and even heaters, and a lovely view of the Aran Islands too. Been there twice now and the food portions are massive, excellent value for money. Tends to be nice and quiet too. Yes. Thank you. (by David Bennett) [a week ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - I was here in 2022 and I thought I already gave this place a review which was a good review in 2022 food was brilliant, well I came back again in 2025 and the food wasn't as good,  I'll put both of the pictures up and judge for yourself,  service was ok wasn't a local , unimpressed this year with everything and it not cheaper either,
I'll try again next time I'm in Doolin and hopefully it will get back to the 2022 standard which was perfection fish and chips with a few bits on the side (by paul) [Edited 3 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Stopped in her for a quick lunch while my friends and I were in Doolin. Was very impressed by the fish and chips we ordered and the quick service! There were seating options both inside and outside but since it was a cooler day we chose to sit indoors.

The man who served us was so funny and had a great sense of humour! We enjoyed listening to his banter with guests as they stopped in to order.

Would definitely recommend! (by Pippa Girling) [a year ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Amazing food, atmosphere and live music. We enjoyed two lovely evenings during our stay in Doolin. (by Philip D.)

We just could have done with more tartar sauce, but that's a minor detail. Overall, it's a nice place, with tasteful outdoor seating in a wooden style. The toilets, tucked away in the backyard, are a bit of a contrast and not nearly as nice. (by Ond≈ôej P≈Øbal) [2 months ago] | Review 9: 4 stars - Good fish and chips.

The food blew all expectations away. It was hearty, well seasoned and all in all delicious. I got the Sheppard's pie and it was bursting with flavour. The pavlova (my favourite) was a generous serving and delicious. As I said it was quiet, therefore I can't rate the atmosphere, other than pleasant. Doesn't get more traditional than this pub for those seeking a bit of culture immersion. Whatever you're doing, you're doing very well. I only recommend perhaps hiring another waiter and front of house.
The pub is located on a large road junction so for those with children and/or mobility restriction, be mindful of fast moving traffic.

View is great and the room is nice (could use some work, especially the bathroom), its clean and the bed is good. From here you can make your trip to the Cliffs of Moher.

The restaurant, which is below the room, can be crowdy, and you smell the backing in the room and the hallway.
The breakfast was good and has a variaty of choices.

Tips: a cooling unit in the room and a locker. (by Willem van Ginkel) | Review 4: None - Great ocean view room with good amenities such as hand lotion. Window opened to bring in fresh cool ocean breeze. Bed was very comfortable, with neat animal photo above. Breakfast was included, and was very good. Not far from the Cliffs of Moher. The worst thing: the shower. Some box mounted on the wall heats the water I guess, but this did not work unless you flip the switch on the outside of the bathroom. Controls were a bit odd. (by Derek) | Review 5: None - We stayed 3 nights in the suites behind the main building.  The rooms were very large with a sitting area, kitchen and one had a had washer/dryer.  Spanish Point is beautiful and you have incredible views from breakfast and the the restaurant.  The staff are very friendly. (by Brendan C. Wackenreuter) | Review 6: None - After a lovely walk around Spanish point we needed a good meal and The coast lodge didn‚Äôt disappoint.
The service was efficient and friendly and the pepperoni pizza I had was the best I have ever tasted,light and full of flavour.
It was not overpriced to eat in with a great view over the bay.
You see a takeaway menu as you walk in which is of course cheaper but having the takeaway option means the staff don‚Äôt have to serve you,provide plates etc or wash up,so the a higher price for a pleasant experience such as we had seems fair to me. (by beverly Shaw) | Review 7: None - A beautiful place right by the sea. The staff is very kind and attentive. We had dinner there and the pizzas were excellent. Breakfast was perfect, and the rooms are spacious, clean, and cozy. (by Marli) | Review 8: None - We love this cafe for it's lovely takeaway food. Pizza is top notch - hence the awards - they even do gluten free. Glorious views from the front garden which is spacious with lots of picnic tables. Staff are friendly and attentive. (by Gareth Major) | Review 9: None - I stopped by for lunch after a surf at Spanish Point. The staff were lovely ‚Äì especially the girl who took our order ‚Äì friendly and helpful throughout. Unfortunately, the overall experience didn‚Äôt live up to expectations.

As you walk in, the bright yellow pricing on the wall catches your eye, but what‚Äôs not obvious is the added charge for eating in ‚Äì even if you're just sitting outside on a picnic bench. For example, fish and chips is advertised at ‚Ç¨14.50 for takeaway, but it jumps to ‚Ç¨21.50 to dine in. When I asked about the difference, I was told it's for ""table service."" Oddly, chicken tenders and chips only had a ‚Ç¨2 surcharge for the same service, which makes the pricing feel inconsistent and a bit unfair. It seems fish and chips ‚Äì possibly their bestseller ‚Äì gets the steepest mark-up.

We weren‚Äôt the only ones confused or disappointed, and it was disheartening to see that the owner showed no interest in addressing customers‚Äô concerns.

While I appreciate the kind staff, we won‚Äôt be recommending or returning. The hotel just up the road may be a little pricier, but it offers much better value for money and a more transparent dining experience. (by Padraic Reilly) | Review 10: None - We stayed for a wedding, room was nice and great location. The breakfast was shocking as there was a green oil all over the plate.

Walked in and just the state of the sandwich boards gave me bad anxiety about my allergies flaring up. I understand that their gluten free options are always a risk with them not being a certified gluten free place. But if they offer it they should make sure the store looks clean and inviting. Very dirty and very disappointing.
Maybe more training is needed! (by Krystle Brown) [a year ago] | Review 7: 2 stars - Looked like only staff member was on, but she went on break and after a minute a young boy came out to serve. While we waited, noticed how untidy the entire salad bar was and some of ingredients looking rather old. The young boy started to make our order when another staff member came out. We had seen 3 staff members now, didn't get any kind of greeting from any of them. Girl returns to shop, only to make her own lunch and chat with other boy who wasn't doing anything. Couldn't get drink I wanted as fridge was not stocked but could see slabs of drinks in back. Serviette dispenser was practically empty.
Wanted to dine in but every single table was dirty. Told staff when we were leaving that every table was dirty. Again, not one response from either three staff members.

Mount Callan House & Restaurant,Clare,,,4.5,,,,,"Review 1: None - My experience at this place was a disastrous one. Within the first few weeks of opening I've ordered the two beef and Guinness stew from their takeaway menu and the beef and the vegetables weren't cooked well. I contacted Richard the manager and I said since you're a new place it'll be better to share my bad experience with you in person than a review online. He apologized for the poor experience and promised me two desserts.
Time flies as life's busy and then yesterday I've ordered the chicken burger and chips from their takeaway menu, I then reminded them about the desserts but unfortunately they had no desserts left. Brought the burger and chips home, the chicken in the burger felt undercooked as it like chewing rubber, too chewy. The chips weren't satisfactory too. Two of my housemates also ordered from the takeaway menu and was totally unsatisfied with their meal.

One might say that the initial experience might have created a perception for the second experience, but I know my chicken meal better than beef meals.

I've heard many people like their sit in menu. But from my experience, the takeaway menu is horrendously poor and there's a great potential for them to improve. Wishing them the very best.

It would have been better to drive to Ennis town and order from reliable restaurants in there.

The old management had
awesome homemade chips.

A symphony of flavors that intertwine.

Spreading laughter and mischief, year after year.

Warm and friendly, their spirits shine bright,
Welcoming patrons from morning till night.
With a twinkle in their eyes and a playful tease,
They create an atmosphere that's sure to please.

Amidst the quaint antiques, treasures of old,
Conversations and laughter effortlessly unfold.

Their bond brings warmth to every sight.

This cafe and antique shop will never fade.

(by Vivian Anne) [3 days ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - This is my seventh day in Ireland on this trip and this is the best (eat out) meal so far! Fresh WILD and natural oysters are so sweet that‚Äôs out of this world. But it‚Äôs not all about the oysters. Must also have the chowder, brown bread and clams (from the special menu). Bread was soft with crunchy crusts and cut in perfect thinness. Clams were cooked in perfection to conserve its natural sweetness and well balanced with white wine and butter sauce. Seafood chowder contained all the goodness from the sea in a just right not too light or too thick creamy broth that is utterly gorgeous. And of course, all the great good must be accompanied by a pint of Guinness or a local G&T for good measures. For Gin, Gunpowder was my choice of the day. Good atmosphere, great music, booking is recommended even in the so called ‚Äúquieter period‚Äù today. All in all, a good crack! Highly recommended.

Chowder was average to my taste. The fish and chips(hake) today was cooked well but the fish had an odd bitterness to it and I suspect was not very fresh. The duck was a very generous portion. Tender, bit under seasoned. The braised red cabbage was nice (by Jason Lam) [2 weeks ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - They serve the biggest oysters I‚Äôve ever seen. The 7 generations chowder is pretty spectacular. I think it was in the top three dishes I had during our tour. The chips were the crispiest, fluffiest fat cut fries and were so good. They serve, hands down, the best pint of Guinness in Ireland, I‚Äôm convinced. The birding is most excellent as well. I think we spotted at least 7 species in a few minutes after dinner. I would cross the Atlantic to have the chowder and pint while gazing at the birds in the river, even if I did nothing else in Ireland.

Price is within the today's range. Not cheap not the dearest. Dinner dishes start from ‚Ç¨17.

However we came here today and found that the choice of food has completely changed.   There was a very limited selection and very little that I could actually order.   In the end I went for a Pizza.   The pizza was beautiful but in honesty Its not my choice of food when I go out for a meal  The only other food I could have ordered from the daily fare would have been cabbage and bacon.   again Not my first choice when out for a meal.   I would have liked to have seen a choice of beef lamb or pork or something else on here.   The staff were friendly and we were happy overall.   PLEASE do add one or 2 more choices of meal.   Price wise this was also a lot more expensive than I expected (compared to previous visits)    Other restaurants that would be in the 15km radius would be better priced (by Vincent Conway) [2 years ago]",https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Arches+Restaurant+-+Claregalway/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x485b9242029ba789:0x12c31ee86a09b18b!8m2!3d53.3447327!4d-8.9429813!16s%2Fg%2F11bbrktcfp!19sChIJiaebAkKSW0gRi7EJaugewxI

We love the chicken sag and lamb jalfrezi! Never a problem - if I could I would give them more stars! (by Rachael White) [Edited a year ago] | Review 10: 1 star - I want to express my disappointment with Spice Temple in Ennis. About a month ago, I ordered a lamb dish and was very happy with it. The food was beautiful, delicious, and came with a nice garlic naan bread along with a sizable lamb portion.

However, my experience took a turn when I ordered again recently. I asked the lady at reception for another lamb dish recommendation. The dish she recommended was very small, almost like a child's portion, which was not at all like the previous portions. The flavor was delicious, but the size was disappointing, especially as a repeat customer.

When I spoke to the manager about this, he was rude. He called me ""man"" dismissively, saying, ""Listen, man."" I replied, ""Excuse me, I'm not your man. My name is Philip, and I'm a customer. I'm not looking for anything free; I paid a substantial amount for my meal and expected the same service as before."" Despite this, the manager kept arguing, insisting this was the normal portion.

Today, I decided to give it another try. I called and spoke to a very nice lady, asking if I could pay extra for more lamb. She said, ""No problem, we'll give you a bigger portion."" However, the manager took over the call and again was dismissive, trying to make me spend more money unfriendly.

I said, ""I'm only bringing this up to ensure the portions aren't small like my last, disappointing experience."" He assured me they were standard pieces and offered an extra $6.99 for four pieces. I explained that I just wanted decent portions, not to spend more. It went on and on, a disgraceful experience.

Paying customers should be treated with respect, not as if they are begging. For a takeaway to cost around ‚Ç¨20 is a sizable amount. For a working man or woman, or anyone ordering food because they're hungry, this treatment is unacceptable. The service was disgraceful, though the food remained delicious.
Very poor customer care and rude management

Four of our group had the chowder, it was absolutely delicious and served with lovely brown bread. The mains were a bit disappointing. Two of us ordered the halibut but we were informed it was no longer available.  I had pan-fried salmon instead, and I wouldn't have it again. It came on a bed of green! Peas, beans, broccoli accompanied with mashed potatoes. Not at all nice. The other members of the group agreed that the main courses need to step up.  We didn't have dessert. As I said the location and chowder fabulous. (by Bernie Malone) | Review 9: None - Been coming to Monks for 20 years and its always a great stop.

What was disappointing was that the men's toilet was not good at all. The toilet seat was covered in unpleasantries, and the ceilings patched up with paper and paint pealing off.

But over all we enjoyed our time and the meal here. (by Lina T) [a year ago] | Review 7: 3 stars - I dined in for lunch at this restaurant while visiting clare. To start with, the service was awful. As we entered the restaurant, the lady at the counter came out with no greeting, but saying we only have time till 2.15pm to order while it was barely 1 o'clock at the time.

The food was average, it was nothing special. I ordered a virgin mojito which was good for the time and for the mains, we ordered a garlic naan and a lemon mustard rice that was served in a good portion, but the chicken madras was pretty much different to what we have had from other Indian restaurants.

Then coming back to the service, the same lady at the counter didn't bother to ask us how the food was, but she was keen to ask the local people who were in the restaurant at the time.
It is also best to have cash if you want to avoid their card surcharge. Overall, it wasn't a good experience!

(by Debi Reed) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 2 stars - I live locally and used to buy bread and pies here often. Since the new owners have taken over sometime ago, it has gone downhill in quality. Most noticeably are the meat pies. They are 95% pastry and gravy and probably even less than 5% meat. If you love a gravy pie, then this is the place for you. At $7:50 each, no thanks !!

Fiddle + Bow Hotel,Clare,,,4.7,,,,,"Review 1: None - Nice hotel and food was good when delivered as ordered. First breakfast was a fail. The omelet ordered with zero tomatoes was riddled with tomatoes. Next day the veggie breakfast which had two eggs previous day only came with one. Very inconsistent.

Be aware the King bed is not a US King but a US Queen. I did know that bed sizes were named differently in some hotels but reached out via email prior to all booked hotels. This was the only stay out of seven that must not have understood my question about bed size.

We stayed in a room with a rain shower head with no shower  door. Looked cool and conceptually would work in a bigger space. However in the space made the bath a dysfunctional wet mess after a shower.

Hotel was a good location and the staff was pleasant. (by D JK) | Review 2: None - This hotel is beautiful! After a long travel day, I was so happy to have stayed here for the evening.

I was warmly welcomed and quickly checked in. The room was beautiful - It was crafted to feel ‚Äúwoodsy/farm-style,‚Äù but felt modern. Once in my room, I found delicious brownies and a handwritten note welcoming me to the hotel. The room was extremely well-kept, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large.

For dinner I ate at the restaurant downstairs (Russel‚Äôs) and the food was amazing!

Breakfast was beautifully laid out. I had a salmon omelette and was able to choose from a variety of juices and other self-serve breakfast options (yogurt, pastries, fruit, etc.).

I highly recommend staying here! (by Alek T. Michali) | Review 3: None - We stayed on a recent visit to Doolin. Amazing property. Close to the cliffs, walking distance to Doolin town.

I highly recommend making the stay for the night at this little place (by Melissa Hayes) | Review 6: None - Overall a great hotel, nice decor and lovely location, very peaceful . My only critique comes with the smell from the AC, a bit moldy. Otherwise we loved our stay here and the staff was very friendly. I also loved their local products in the hotel lobby and the coffee pressing pot and teas to promote sleep. (by Mario A) | Review 7: None - We had a lovely stay in The Loft at the Fiddle and Bow.

Was great experience,  but it was expensive as well. (by bjanik2002) | Review 9: None - Hi, Last night, we dined at your restaurant and ordered the seafood platter. We were quite disappointed to find it consisted mainly of mussels, lobster, crab claws, and just two pieces of chewy calamari. To our surprise, there were no oysters, scallops, prawns, or fish included. This hardly seems like a true seafood platter. It was a letdown, especially considering it was the only negative dining experience we've had during our time in Ireland.. (by Chris Jensen) | Review 10: None - Very cute and quiet hotel, mattress was very comfortable. The staff and overall attitude towards service is where the problems start. The lady who works the days is abrupt and nearly rude in how she addressed us. Both mornings for breakfast we made simple requests that at other fine hotels would have been honored (not wanting to order a large breakfast, only requesting 2 scrambled eggs - this request was denied as ‚Äúthey‚Äôve gone strict‚Äù although we watched another guest have their request honored the morning prior). The gentleman working evenings was always very accommodating and polite. Overall I‚Äôd look to stay somewhere else next time in Doolin. Not impressed with their level of service at all.

Great food, great service and a chilled atmosphere. We have never been disappointed at any outlet. Happy to report that the Palladium outlet is similar - prompt service, great food. We ordered the Avaccado on sour dough (must try), eggs Florentine(if you like sour butter sauce), peri peri chicken (all time favourite) and pesto pizza (very good!), ham and cheese sandwich(finger licking good). Try what you want, my guess is everything is made well! (by Amrita Purkayastha) [a year ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Surprisingly for a chain, and a place that's been open for so long, I really enjoyed my visit to Smoke House Deli.

At the Phoenix outlet, we were able to sit outside and enjoy the brief Bombay winter, which was a perfect backdrop to our hot drinks.

We got an Irish Coffee and Adult Hot Chocolate, and loved both. We also ordered Naga Paneer Skewers which were good, as well as the cauliflower from their Christmas menu. Finished off with a dark chocolate gelato, which was good again. (by Utkarsh Dalal) [8 months ago] | Review 4: 3 stars - Visited this place 2 weeks ago. The Nachos for starters was really yummy. Tomato and Mascarpone risotto is a must must have. Fennel and Rosemary chicken frank was okay. The garlic break was nice decent size portion. Mac and cheese was really good too.  Had the smoked chicken and Oregano burger the bread felt a bit stale and the patty was okay it was just breaking apart.

Overall the service was a bit slow. Ambience was decent. (by Rosemary Pattem) [3 years ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Been here on multiple occasions and I love it always. The vast menu spoils you for choice. I haven‚Äôt been able to try everything yet.

Recommendations:

BBQ Chicken and Cheddar Melt Croissant Sandwich
Grilled Prawns In Cilantro Garlic Chilli Butter (by Suchita) [a year ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - This is a good place to hangout. The ambience is pretty good with good wall art, lighting and seating arrangement.  The staff is very friendly, prompt and helpful.
There is a site on which you have the menu and food can be ordered on the site itself. Good feature. They still have some issues with the payment on the site but should be resolved.
It has a full functional bar and food is delicious. Plating and presentation is good.
We had ordered 2 Kalledevarapura Estate Coffees (Dark Roast) given in a French press along with milk on the side. Spaghetti arrabiata was a balanced taste and not too tangy. Fennel and rosmary chicken hot dog was good.
Apple crumble tart was not bad but pie could be better, cinnamon flavour was overpowering. It was served with an ice cream which had a smoky flavour maybe for the name of the Deli. Hazelnut mousse flan was very smooth for the mousse part and had a layer of oats/cornflakes base which also gave it a crunchy side.
All in all a good experience. (by saket sagdeo) [2 years ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - The steak sandwich was the star, followed by the hazelnut mousse flan. Highly recommended. Service is slow so if you are hungry and can't wait, then this isn't the best place. Sausage charcuterie was kind of a stew affair. Nice but a little unexpected. (by Pulastya Dave) [3 years ago] | Review 8: 2 stars - It took us 10mins to decide on menu as they have nothing specifically special but too many common dishes. We ordered smoke house deli special pasta and hot chocolate. Pasta was loaded with oil, and less vegetables. And hot chocolate with lot of water. We spotted small cockroach on our table.
Price - very high, expensive for the taste
Ambiance- cool! (by sayali pawar) [a year ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Can never go wrong with whatever you eat here. Tried the Greek Salad with Feta, Slow cooked Lamb Shanks, Pesto Spaghetti, Christmas pudding and Tiramisu. Absolutely loved it. The lamb was surprisingly cold when served however it was re heated immediately. (by kamlesh kotenkar) [3 years ago] | Review 10: 4 stars - Smoke House Deli has been a well known name for quite a while now, but somehow had escaped my radar, until last night, when I met up with a group of friends for dinner. Being a Friday night I had anticipated a lot of rush so booked a table in advance and that turned out to be a good call, as none of the tables were free when we got there. The decor is pleasing to the eye, seats are reasonably comfy, though the AC could've been a bit stronger, but maybe that's just me. We started off with their offer on Bacardi and Antiquity, though they have offers on sangria, LIIT, wine as well. For appetizers we ordered the Grilled Chermoula Rubbed Chicken Skewers, while the vegetarians in our group had the Curried Cottage Cheese Skewers, and for a change I liked the vegetarian variant more, thanks to its delicious sauce. Our third and final appetizer was the Slow Roasted Plum Tomato with Basil Soup, which was the right amount of tangy, the way I like it. Being a group of 6 people, our focus was on the mains. First up we had Spaghetti in Spicy Arrabbiata and Fusili in Cheesy Alfredo. Both were very good, for me the spaghetti was the winner between the two. Up next was Peri Peri Rubbed Grilled Chicken, a very impressive dish, not only was the chicken great but also the accompanying rice. This was followed by the Peppercorn Crusted Steak, cooked medium-rare, which was quite decent, not too chewy. The last for the mains was Chilli Crusted John Dory, and that was the highlight of our meal.  It was so good we ordered it twice! The fish, john dory, was brilliant, and I enjoyed the accompanying risotto as well, inspite of not being much of a risotto person. We rounded off the meal with New York Cheesecake for dessert. It was standard fare, tasty as usually cheesecakes are. So to sum up then, excellent food, plenty of variety, very courteous and well informed staff, and though by no means easy on the pocket, I strongly recommend Smoke House Deli, a restaurant I'll be visiting again for sure.

Dromoland Castle Hotel,Clare,,,4.8,,,,,"Review 1: None - My partners parents worked at this beautiful venue over 40 years ago‚Ä¶ They took us on a trip down memory lane on a recent visit.

You know this place is top notch when you pass the gate house, glide up the drive past the fishing lake and golf course to the front doors‚Ä¶ There was also a falconry lesson on the lawn as we arrived just to add to the splendid first impressions.

In reception the flowers are fresh and abundant, every surface sparkles with the super friendly sartorial team awaiting your arrival.

Wonderful historical interior with the walls festooned with portraits, paintings, taxidermy and trinkets. The main staircase sweeps down into a long hall reminiscent of a glamorous Hollywood thriller.

Whilst our hosts reminisced about bygone halcyon days of presidential visits, old staff members, cantankerous guests and beautiful chandeliers we made our way to the stunning cocktail bar overlooking the lake.

Our ‚Äògo to‚Äô tipple is a Negroni which were as expected first rate, others enjoyed Irish coffees and beers chosen from an extensive list of beverages.

Sadly we had dinner reservations elsewhere, however, the dining room is equally stunning with a well rounded menu with mains being served under cloches - don‚Äôt you love a little dining drama!

The team were attentive and friendly with the edge that a five star hotel brings‚Ä¶ We will be back hopefully to stay sometime soon.

We were even talked into ordering the souffl√© from one of the incredible staff members (I wish I could remember his name). We had great service for after dinner drinks while we listened to traditional music. (by Kylie) | Review 9: None - Words can't express about the experience of staying in a castle. Once in a lifetime.

The food was very average.
Since we weren‚Äôt that hungry, we ordered two entr√©es and one main.
‚Ä¢ The kingfish sashimi was disappointing, it lacked seasoning and flavour.
‚Ä¢ The prawns themselves were delicious, but the cream underneath tasted off and a bit sour, not how it should.
‚Ä¢ The whiting was good, but again, the base (cream/hummus) had an odd taste that didn‚Äôt seem right.

On a positive note, the service was great.
Overall, I feel the place is overpriced for what they offer. (by Fernanda Lucena) [2 weeks ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - Great vibes in the beautiful region of Clare valley

Clare valley, wine country and home to some of the world's best Riesling. Amongst all this wine comes one of the better breweries I've been to, with some great tasting food

The food was outstanding, the service from Hayley was friendly, attentive and warm. Outstanding dining in a relaxed atmosphere. (by Belinda Wellings) [2 weeks ago] | Review 5: 1 star - Very unimpressed. We ordered the lamb, the garfish and the chicken. We were delivered beef, which the waitress took back and replaced with the lamb after about 15 minutes, which was what we had ordered. The chicken was served, medium rare, which was bloody around the bone. The lamb was very tough and gristly. For what we paid, $46, we expected much better. They did drop a complimentary salad to the table to make up for the incorrect mains being served, however, this was bland and tasteless.  When the bill came, they had comped the 2 hassleback potato sides we had ordered.  Which to be honest were the best parts of the meal. We had a really nice Pyke and Joyce Pinot Noir. I‚Äôll be honest the staff seemed ambivalent to the fact, they made a mistake with the order. There was no apology offered with the delivery of the food or even when we paid the bill.  We won‚Äôt be coming back. (by mattrobx) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Came in December '22 with a different chef....went again tonight. I wouldn't say it's a significant change because the first time was so lovely. We were greeted by a very friendly wait staff and taken to our table with glee even though we were running late (give them a heads up).
Instead of going to the feed me menu we decided to go our own way and select √Ä la carte.
I personally had the oysters (absolute blast of flavours), the Carpaccio I shared with my partner (which I'd order again....and again) and then the duck for dinner (beautifully cooked - although could have fallen off the bone better).
Anytime we come up to Clare this will be a must. Looking forward to visiting Pikes tomorrow (by Tim Summers) [2 years ago] | Review 7: 2 stars - Great setting and some lovely food but also some genuine misses as well the cremeux dessert was sloppy and deflated, the lettuce salad on the menus was coleslaw (they did advise this) but the main issue was the service.
It felt like cleaning tables was not a priority, our mains came without a chance to order wine with the main course after trying to get some attention & our purchase of dessert wine came with some ‚Äòinteresting‚Äô pours & upon questioning we were told some on the table were lucky to receive a generous pour - we were not tasting but purchasing a glass and the difference was noticeable. this left a sour note to our visit and also meant we didn‚Äôt make some costly purchases.
A shame as if the one percenters were done well the experience could have been five stars. (by Nicky Pearce) [4 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Known predominantly for its amazing wines, Pikes restaurant Slate fits like a glove into their portfolio of excellence.

From the moment you arrive you are met with the perfect balance between opulence and country charm.

Our table on the timber decking blended effortlessly into its surrounds as our uninterrupted view of the vineyards was a constant reminder of why we drove to Clare in the first place.

The menu options were plentiful, so our only choice was to order many and attempt to share hahaha

Zucchini Flowers w/ Prawn Mousse, Braised Octopus w/ Squid Ink, Pan Seard Mulloway, Pork Jowl and Duck Fat Potatoes were just some of the plates we thoroughly enjoyed.

One thing that stood out for us, was the attention given to Gluten Free options.
As a Coeliac my wife quite often misses out on simple pleasures like bread but not at Slate. The house made GF bread was incredible, so much so we asked if they would sell a loaf.

Special shout out to our waitress Monique. Her bubbly personality, infectious laugh and passion for people only added to what was already a wonderful day.

The Harbour Restaurant,Clare,"Creek Marina, Cappagh, Kilrush, Co. Clare, V15 PN27, Ireland",Restaurant,4.5,,+353 65 905 1087,,,"Review 1: 4 stars - First time visiting the harbour tonight. Really beautiful restaurant decor modern and chic. Staff were very warm and attentive never too long waiting for a drink. I ordered the duck breast which is how it's described on the menu I have to say it tasted exquisite and came with sweet potatoe puree, steamed veggies and some mash however as it was described on the menu as 'breast of duck' I expected that it would infact be a full duck breast. Unfortunately it was as if a duck breast was sliced into 5/6 pieces and I was served 2 slices of it on the plate rather than whole breast. This was disappointing as it is priced at 28 euro. Despite this I cannot fault the flavours or how it was cooked. If the kitchen was maybe running low on duck perhaps I would have rather been told as I could have ordered something else or at least been discounted for the much smaller portion as it definitely was not a full duck breast.

The only thing I will say is that there's not much choice for vegans (so I settled on the risotto) but the food is so good, the atmosphere was wonderful and the staff were so kind and attentive! We would definitely be back, 10/10‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® (by Crystal Campbell) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - We had a lovely meal here the food was delicious I had the crab claw starter the sauce was so nice.followed by hake in a lovely white wine sauce and a lovely creme brulee my favourite dessert. If I could give some advice it would be the service. I felt the experience is lacking here and so many businesses get this wrong your front of house staff can make or break your business so it's very important to get it right. It's the attention to detail was lacking quite a few times I tried to get their attention and was ignored. I'll put it down to finding their feet and hope when I visit again soon
( as I really enjoyed the food) I can write a review to include exceptional service. (by Rose Lane) [2 months ago] | Review 8: 1 star - Don't be dazzled by the bright lights and nice exterior. We looked up the menu online before driving across from the marina  to the restaurant, we were excited because it looked super especially as they had fillet steak! We had to ask to be seated at a very wobbly table after 3 servers passed us by without acknowledgement. All there was to drink was water, when we asked what was on offer with no alcohol the waitress laughed at us and said you have to wait for the bar to open because there's no drinks menu,  we just wanted a soft drink or zero that wasn't water and we had no idea what time the bar opened - we were there at 5.30pm. One of us is Gluten Free so adding everything up in our heads we didn't really want to chance it. There seemed to be no manager just very young shy staff that hadn't been trained. We left very disappointed and headed for another establishment in Spanish Point for an amazing Steak dinner, we won't bother chancing it in Kilrush again. (by Lily Joyce) [2 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - I'm Coeliac and the team could not do enough for me, the choice range for gluten free is very good. Have been many times since it opened, it's that good.Special mention to the wonderful waitress who made her first ever hot chocolate for me! As locals,(blow ins but locals) this is the best place to eat in Kilrush.

Big Boy,Clare,"10240 S Clare Ave, Clare, MI 48617, United States",Restaurant,3.4,,,,,"Review 1: 3 stars - I grew up on Bob's Big Boy in the 70s  and it was awesome but Bob's Big Boy's are few and far between so while traveling through Michigan we were excited to find this gem. Inside was a bit old and ran down, floors and walls were stained and dirty making us rethink our decision to stop but the need to eat at Bob's once again was stronger so we ordered. Menu isn't the same, there's many many new foods which would be expected over time but they do still have a few classics. The Bob's classic burger combo plate with burger, fries and salad is gone and the original relish on the burger is also gone, now replaced with thousand Island dressing making this burger just a burger and not a ""BBB"" burger so it was disappointing but still tasty. Everyone's food was tasty don't get me wrong, and the highlight of our meal was the chocolate hot fudge cake that was and still is in the menu, yay! It arrived at our table in all it's beautiful glory this classic deserves and was very but as delicious as I remembered! Without this classic dessert this lunch would have been a bust. So for me the things we first noticed weren't enough to overcome the negatives I'm afraid.  It's just not the original BBB anymore and unfortunately, it's just a restaurant called BBB. If you're like me who grew up on BBB the only plus here was the dessert I'm afraid. HOWEVER...I did come across several BBB in my travels through Michigan that were definitely newer and most inviting and would have tried one of these for sure but my husband who wasn't a fan and certainly not after our last visit so I didn't try any of them but would definitely one of them so don't misunderstand me, I'm almost certain the newer restaurants ARE going to be more like the BBB I remember so maybe pass on this particular BBB...

Out of items with no note saying which items are out of only tell you if you try to order something they will tell you there out. I got chicken parmesan recently and the chicken was still rare not fully cooked and I got sick off of it. The loaded Mac and cheese was missing toppings. We can't get ahold of anyone at corporate and no one will return our phone calls to make it right. Slow service many times. (by James Liabenow) [a week ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Best Bob's sampler I've ever had.

Hash browns cold and chewy, eggs half cooked, chicken fried steak like leather. We may give them another shot in 6 months or so just because our Waitress was amazing and the free desert delicious. (by Rich Carmody) [4 weeks ago] | Review 7: 1 star - A Thursday night 630 pm. NOT busy. Had the soup and salad bar. Only 1 scorched pot of nasty looking soup. Salad bar was 90% empty.

Would recommend to NOT eat here. Very POOR service and food quality was GROSS (by Scott Johnson) [a month ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - We had the breakfast buffet. Food was hot and freshly stocked.

You can tell right away this facility is not cleaned and maintained properly! 20 minute or more wait for a slim Jim and Philly steak sandwich at a slow time of day. Fries came out cold. Bathroom was VERY dirty and needed to be cleaned. Several tables were covered with dirty dishes (needed to be bussed) the entire time we were there. The breakfast bar had been broken down but there was old food laying all over the bar and the steam tables were left on, and uncovered.  The smell and sight of the dirty steam water was AWEFULL! The casing around the exit door is rotting and full of cob webbs. The landscape area out front is full of weeds! I dont expect a Big Boy to be a 5 star place but cmon.... take some pride in your restaurant! I will say, our server was very nice, and kind.

Making wise cracks.. then she comes right back out with it ü§î Flip it over, and sure enough.. they made weak attempt at wiping off sour cream, and flipped it over and reserved it to us!! My wife showed it to them, asked for manager.. Girl comes from the cooks line says oh noo we will make a fresh one! So by time his food comes were done eating.. I spot a mushroom poking out of potato cake, so I grabbed it with my fork.. (he HATES mushrooms) flip it open and it's wrong potato cake! Has mushroom, green pepper & onion.. (supposed be bacon, sausage, & ham) waitress offers to have it made AGAIN, at this point he says just bring me a plain cheeseburger please.. nothing on it but cheese.. (can't mess that up right?) She brings him a kids jr big boy..(he's 25) lettuce, sauce.. definitely not plain. He took 2 bites. Not going for 4th attemp to get food right so we asked for the bill. Gave us an 85$ bill! My wife said no way! Told them needed speak to manager.. and they bring this completely different woman from the back.. claiming she was the manager.. and had no idea. I guarantee this big boy will be closed soon like the rest. These people are incompetent. When ordering my son asked the waitress difference between strawberry shake and strawberry shortcake shake, she looked at him baffled and replied ""I have no idea."" And then just stared at him. Sure miss big boy.. but there's no way I'd eat there.

Hylands Burren Hotel,Clare,,,4.2,,,,,"Review 1: None - Room was fine, comfortable sleeps. Food was extremely good at breakfast & evening. They have a superb Brazilian chef who is passionate about food quality & preparation. His fish chowder is absolutely the BEST we have tasted ANYWHERE. Evening dining was also of the highest quality. The chef is also a fantastic drummer on his Peruvian drum & joins in the evening entertainment. Service is quick & attentive. Great car parking, though would like to see a few EV chargers. (by David Kelly) | Review 2: None - A great wee find! We have stopped off here for food when travelling on numerous occasions over last 10 years it's consistently excellent.

(by Mary Rooney) | Review 3: None - Great hotel for the price and location, we had a very comfortable beds. The rooms in general were clean and the staff were lovely.
The hotel is more dated than other photos suggests though, the carpets were old, shower curtain had mildew, shower was clogged, windows were old, lots of spiders and general corners and windowsills of the hotel weren't cleaned with lots of dead flies on them. The cooked breakfast was lovely but the fruit and juice tasted old as it has that fizzy quality. (by Beth) | Review 4: None - Good hotel, needs a bit of a refurb in places.

It was close ‚Ä¶ (by C6988HLwilliamk) | Review 6: None - Such a weird experience staying at this hotel this weekend.

The location was great for what we wanted and we enjoyed visiting the pubs of Ballyvaughan and relaxing for the evening. When we got into the room, there was something in the toilet that I couldn't identify and it was gross, but went away with a flush so happy out. We decided to try the hotel for food since we had been to the other restaurants in Ballyvaughan.  When we ordered our food, I tried to switch baby potatoes for creamed.  Literally told no... so odd when it's such a small thing.  When the food came out, they brought my partner the wrong dish and it had to be sent back.  I was starving and so my meal was completely done by the time he got his.  We left for a bit and ended up back in the hotel hours later for final drinks.  My gin and tonic was delivered as pure ice- there was no gin in it, the bartender had forgotten to put it in.  Okay cool.  Next morning, we ordered breakfast and once again they messed up our food order.  I ordered eggs benedict with bacon and they delivered it with salmon, which makes me gag.  I immediately flagged it and sent it back to get the right order.  When it came back (after my partner had finished his breakfast), it was absolutely DOUSED in hollandaise which was also disgusting.  I tried to push it to the side and as I did I saw there was still salmon on the dish, hiding underneath the bacon.  If I had a fish allergy I'd probably be dead but luckily not.  It was stomach-turning and I let the waiter know and asked if I could just have two sausage links so that I wasn't starving on our drive back to Galway.  He said they were ""out of sausages"", then saw some get delivered to another table a bit later.

All in all, nice people but horrible service.  Not sure if the issue was the chef or the people taking our orders or the combination of both, but probably would not return. (by Alanna Scully) | Review 7: None - The 4 is because of the location, the hotel is small dated and no A/C. Lots of street noise with the windows open. Was happy to only stay a night. Wouldn‚Äôt have checked out early if we had more days planned in the area. Affordable but not very comfortable.

Be aware that Balleyvaughan is in the middle of nowhere with very little public transport available. But there are some good restaurants: Monks and The Soda Shop in particular.

View is great and the room is nice (could use some work, especially the bathroom), its clean and the bed is good. From here you can make your trip to the Cliffs of Moher.

The restaurant, which is below the room, can be crowdy, and you smell the backing in the room and the hallway.
The breakfast was good and has a variaty of choices.

Tips: a cooling unit in the room and a locker. (by Willem van Ginkel) | Review 4: None - Great ocean view room with good amenities such as hand lotion. Window opened to bring in fresh cool ocean breeze. Bed was very comfortable, with neat animal photo above. Breakfast was included, and was very good. Not far from the Cliffs of Moher. The worst thing: the shower. Some box mounted on the wall heats the water I guess, but this did not work unless you flip the switch on the outside of the bathroom. Controls were a bit odd.

Wackenreuter) | Review 6: None - After a lovely walk around Spanish point we needed a good meal and The coast lodge didn‚Äôt disappoint.
The service was efficient and friendly and the pepperoni pizza I had was the best I have ever tasted,light and full of flavour.
It was not overpriced to eat in with a great view over the bay.
You see a takeaway menu as you walk in which is of course cheaper but having the takeaway option means the staff don‚Äôt have to serve you,provide plates etc or wash up,so the a higher price for a pleasant experience such as we had seems fair to me.

Pizza is top notch - hence the awards - they even do gluten free. Glorious views from the front garden which is spacious with lots of picnic tables. Staff are friendly and attentive. (by Gareth Major) | Review 9: None - I stopped by for lunch after a surf at Spanish Point. The staff were lovely ‚Äì especially the girl who took our order ‚Äì friendly and helpful throughout. Unfortunately, the overall experience didn‚Äôt live up to expectations.

As you walk in, the bright yellow pricing on the wall catches your eye, but what‚Äôs not obvious is the added charge for eating in ‚Äì even if you're just sitting outside on a picnic bench. For example, fish and chips is advertised at ‚Ç¨14.50 for takeaway, but it jumps to ‚Ç¨21.50 to dine in. When I asked about the difference, I was told it's for ""table service."" Oddly, chicken tenders and chips only had a ‚Ç¨2 surcharge for the same service, which makes the pricing feel inconsistent and a bit unfair. It seems fish and chips ‚Äì possibly their bestseller ‚Äì gets the steepest mark-up.

We weren‚Äôt the only ones confused or disappointed, and it was disheartening to see that the owner showed no interest in addressing customers‚Äô concerns.

While I appreciate the kind staff, we won‚Äôt be recommending or returning. The hotel just up the road may be a little pricier, but it offers much better value for money and a more transparent dining experience. (by Padraic Reilly) | Review 10: None - We stayed for a wedding, room was nice and great location. The breakfast was shocking as there was a green oil all over the plate.

Fitz's Pub,Clare,"Hotel Doolin, Rivervale, Doolin, Co. Clare, Ireland",Bar,4.3,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 3 stars - We stopped in the pub on September 10 for a late lunch.  I'd read an article about great restaurants in Doolin.  When we got to Doolin, there was only one place open.  So, we went to Fitz's Pub.  We walked in and there were many open tables but they all had dirty dishes on them.  I asked if we could get a table for two and the young girl told me that it would be about ten minutes.  So, we literally just stood around and tried to stay out of people's way.  Then some time later another employee asked me what I needed, I told her a table for two.  I asked if we could have the cute little table nestled in the corner.   She told me that she was seating someone else there (someone who just walked in).  So, I asked if we could have the table closest to the bar as there was only a small amount of dirty dishes on it.  She allowed us to take that table and someone came and cleaned it.  All in, we probably stood around awkwardly for 20 minutes.  We sat down and the server seemed irritated.  We had already ordered our drinks at the bar so we just ordered two seafood chowders.  The chowders were not bad, not great.  Mine had a mussel with a broken shell and a mussel with a clamped closed shell.  Couldn't eat those.  The pints were good.
I'm giving three stars, that being said, it wasn't a good experience (by Tia Pirkl) [a week ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - If you are here, you should try the red ale and the lager beer made in Doolin. I drank it and liked it. The bar has a nice interior but it was noisy. It is generally a very touristy place and there are a lot of tourists.

I do wish the portions were a bit bigger but the quality of the meal made up for it!
Worth noting that some items on the menu were mistakenly missing certain allergen labels (ie. gluten). Fortunately, our waitress double-checked our order was gluten free with the kitchen before submitting it! (by Lauren Uhl) [3 weeks ago] | Review 4: 3 stars - The food was edible but nothing special. Prices were steep: 3 meatballs for ‚Ç¨12, both the burger and the beer-battered fish were ‚Ç¨21 each. The burger patty was thick and tasty, but it lacked sauce. The fish came with caper aioli, which was good but barely a tablespoon spread thinly on the plate. Two out of three fish pieces were clearly overcooked and too dark, which affected the taste (the on pice that wasn't over cooked was actually good and crispy). The potatoes (served with both dishes) were bland and overly greasy. The sauce served with them resembled cold, watery tomato pur√©e. Food took about 25 minutes to arrive, service was average.
I gave 3/5 because overpriced for what you get. (by Liisa Helena Rei) [3 months ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Was brought here by the tour guide during my cliff of mother tour.

(by Katja Hennessey) [2 weeks ago] | Review 9: 4 stars - We were taken here via a bus tour.  Nice place country feel to it.  Staff was extremely busy shuffling one bus after the next but kept their smile going.  The chowder was decent and the fish fry was also good.  The open faced sandwiches were less than satisfying.  The chicken was a cold curry based chicken chunk.  The menu didn't mention such a strong spice, and should.  The crab sandwich was little to be desired. In our opinion this is a tourist trap restaurant and prices reflected that too. (by Andrea Bartels) [a year ago] | Review 10: 4 stars - Very nice waiters but when we asked for a kids menu they took 10 minutes and we had to ask for it 3 times, and we had to ask 4 times for water when other people got it straight away. When we ordered it took an extremely long time for are food to come (over half an hour). After 20 mins we asked them when our food was ready and they said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll ask the kitchen‚Äù and they asked 10 minutes later.

The atmosphere was nice and calm. The music was nice but they didn‚Äôt play for long. Eventually when our food came, it was very delicious (highly recommend the fish chowder).

She absolutely had a terrible attitude, not answering the door for the fed ex worker. Shaking her head she wasn't answering the door!  Shaking her head no to a paying customer whom gets a big order at the end of every month for their business. The doors was locked during business hours.  The workers rolled their eyes and said no, not answering the door. Rude. So that big account will take their business elsewhere.

Took another 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile our pizza, one wing and crazy bread are getting cold. The employee at the counter was very nice apologetic for order being delayed. Manager on site was rude. Asked for sauce for crazy bread said it would cost more. Asked for my money back she denied a refund. Said I‚Äôd have to deal with the general manager who would be in on Sunday.

I get Little Caesars quite a bit  from several locations and I'll tell you what: this was honest to goodness, the absolute BEST pizza that I have been served from ANY Little Caesars that I have EVER been to.  The guy behind the counter was super friendly, welcoming, and the service was great.
I assume that the other guy and the lovely young lady in the back prepared my pizza, and it was absolutely perfect.  I wish I would have gotten their names because they all will be getting at least a five dollar tip from me the  next time I see that they are working.  I even called just to brag up how delicious their pizza was in the hopes that they feel my appreciation.  That was probably (no joke!) the best pizza I've ever had.  Freakin' fantastic job you three.  To nail it like that on a super crazy busy weekend like Labor Day is awesome.  I'd be thrilled if y'all made my pizzas every time.  Cheers.

We visited on the busiest day of the week but managed to get a table upstairs.

Bright point was the bar attendant from the busy downstairs bar who took our drink  order but personally brought it up to us. Menu was standard stodgy fare with no vegetarian options and only salad option being a Caesar. We opted for the spicy chicken wing platter which was tasty.

(by Minh Le) [6 months ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - First time visiting Pinto restaurant, we‚Äôve  been in Clare for a few nights and wanted to try somewhere different and this place hit the spot. Took us a few minutes to get here as Apple hasn‚Äôt updated the new location which by the way is situated in the Woolies complex but once we finally found this place it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Staff were super friendly, the food was to die for very flavoursome, fresh and vibrant
The only downside for me was there were no bathroom amenities in the restaurant, you had to walk to the end of the shopping complex (At the side of Woolies) which was probably half a minute walk but apart from this minor sett back the food is amazing well worth a visit (by lisa stephenson) [6 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Absolutely delicious food. Wish I lived closer as I would eat here all the time. Will definitely return if I'm in or near the area.

Only negative was that it was inside the pub and the atmosphere wasn't great. There was music playing over the pub speakers as well as the restaurants own speaker and listening to 2 songs at the same time was strange.

Saw that they are only at this location until end of April and will announce details soon. Hoping they are moving to their own restaurant ü§ûüèª (by Melanie Pascoe) [a year ago] | Review 6: 1 star - Honestly, pretty terrible. After spending $115 on a takeaway treat for my parents who live locally, we were all disappointed. For $115, we got Pad Thai, Basil Chicken, Satay, Dumplings and Kingfish Crudo - a good price if it had tasted good.

The Kingfish Krudo was very average and had a fishy taste that made me unsure of its freshness - this is something I'd order a lot when eating out and something I‚Äôve made at home myself. I‚Äôve had better elsewhere, but it was probably one of the better dishes.

The dumplings had a distinctly weird taste, to the extent that 2 out of 3 of us spat ours out into the bin - no one ate more than one each, and 5 out of 8 were wasted. This isn‚Äôt even about them being frozen. As a fan of dumplings, I often eat frozen at home - these had a weird ‚Äòoff taste‚Äô.

The satay was thin and bland - the sauce that accompanied it was not the peanutty satay sauce you might expect, but a red curry sauce.

The Basil Chicken was so overpoweringly garlicky that the car smelled of it when we came home, and it overpowered any other flavours in the dish. The basil was almost indistinguishable, and it was really very little - a thin layer across some rice. My mum couldn‚Äôt eat it at all, it was so strong.

The Pad Thai was gloopy and had an artificial lemon flavour - no need for the lemon segment on the side. The prawns in this dish were good, but overall, it was a real letdown. That said, it‚Äôs the best of a bad bunch.

It‚Äôs really disappointing. We‚Äôve been meaning to try Pinto for ages - we usually end up getting the amazing curries from the Ampol - but we will never come back and won‚Äôt recommend it to anyone in the Clare Valley.

EDIT after Pinto‚Äôs reply: I appreciate the response, but it feels more like deflection than genuine engagement. I‚Äôve travelled extensively in Thailand and eat Thai food often ‚Äî this wasn‚Äôt a case of ‚Äúnot understanding authentic flavours,‚Äù it just wasn‚Äôt good.
We ate the crudo first, as advised, and it still tasted strange. I‚Äôm aware satay isn‚Äôt made with peanut butter, but your satay sauce resembled red curry more than anything satay-style. The dumplings had an unpleasant flavour ‚Äî not a matter of personal preference, but quality. The basil chicken was overwhelmingly garlicky - I expect garlic, but I also expect to taste the other flavours too, and the Pad Thai was reheated properly but still gloopy and artificial tasting.
I don‚Äôt leave negative reviews lightly. You‚Äôre entitled to defend your food, but dismissing customer experience as ignorance isn‚Äôt the way to do it. (by Shelley Travers) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - We were both craving something made from start with fresh vegetables, a bit of spice and just the right size after a few days up north of Clare in the dessert. Out of the blue our wishes were granted when we wandered in early evening to the Pinto. The dishes being prepared wafting from the kitchen had us hooked. An amazing vegetable stir fry from local seasonal vegetables with some chillies and saffron rice had us in heaven.
Great presentation,  wonderful atmosphere and top class friendly service is not something you come across often enough anymore.

Booked in for a 65th birthday celebration, so had high hopes the place would be at least half decent.
Ordered spring rolls for three as a starter plus a main each. Two of us ordered a pad Thai as a main, only to be told they only had one left. Alarm bells straight away........Are their meals pre prepared to have run out of this simple noodle dish! I changed my first choice and went for a simple veg stir fry for $20.00 as well as a garlic roti.
50 minutes later still no spring rolls despite only one other table of four in the restaurant.
My stir fry finally arrived on a small side plate, being a single layer of luke-warm vegetables that became instantly cold. No rice or noodles in site.
My roti was limp and dripping with oil that ran off my fingers when I picked it up.  I left it uneaten on the plate.
The unlucky guest who did receive the last pad Thai, had a bowl of cold, gluggy noodles that couldn't be separated and rubber prawns.
The birthday boy's pork dish wasn't much better, was also tiny, luke-warm and with the pieces of pork unevenly cooked. This was actually a very expensive dish on the menu. Apparently the jasmine rice was very nice!
The lovely young waitress asked how our meals were... I decided to be honest and told her the food was a huge disappointment. No apologies or offer of a refund.
On leaving and preparing to pay the bill I enquired about the spring rolls for three that never arrived. Of course they were clearly there on the bill. These were taken off but we still paid $140.00 for the three of us. We had a guest from Queensland with us, and had hoped for a nice memory of his brother's 65th birthday. We now wish we hadn't bothered with this place and just went to Subway or one of the local pubs instead.
Despite being locals, we will not be having anything to do with this place again and cannot recommend it to others. (by Andy Applebee) [5 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - What a find!  This cosy restaurant was close to the hotel we stayed in, on a recent visit to Clare from Adelaide.  Both my husband and I ordered special fried rice (beef for my husband and crispy chicken for me).

The room was immaculate, with a lovely layout and a super comfortable bed. The cleanliness was top-notch, and I felt right at home. The service was impeccable, especially from Nicole, who greeted me warmly at check-in and later took care of me at the bar during dinner. Speaking of dinner, the meal was fantastic! Overall, it was a truly great experience, and I highly recommend it! (by Nick Crowe) | Review 3: None - Bentleys is an ‚Äòacceptable‚Äô choice in Clare if you need a single night‚Äôs accommodation on a Saturday night (so hard to find given the two night minimum curse!!) but, other than that advantage, there is not too much else to say that is ‚Ä¶ (by LisaMDL) | Review 4: None - Went here for a Sunday lunch to meet my mum... the service was great.
The meals were really good, the slow cooked bourbon ribs were fantastic, meat fell off the bone and full of taste, mum had the pork roast of the day and enjoyed it.
My partner had a chicken parmi and it was huge, took half of it home when a doggy bag was offered.
We enjoyed our visit and will return again.
Thank you! (by Amanda Auty) | Review 5: None - Been to Clare a few times but, never to this pub. Thought we‚Äôd give it a try for dinner. Walked in not many people in the pub at the time. We ordered a pint of beer and a sprite. The sprite turned out to be soda water but, we didn‚Äôt take it back. Partner walked up to the bar to order another beer, stood at the bar for a long time whilst the barman kept talking to other people sitting at the bar and the other lady serving kept putting menus on vacant tables. Didn‚Äôt look like they were going to serve him any time soon so we walked out of the pub and went to the Clare Hotel where we got served drinks quickly and correctly. üòÇ (by A L) | Review 6: None - Spent a week in Clare for work, and was my go to dinner location every night.

Had pizzas the 1st night which were fresh & great. Chicken schnitzel & a vegan schnitzel the 2nd night, with chips & salad. Also great.
But what made it a great experience was the wonderful atmosphere & awesome staff.
A very friendly welcome from the lovely lady Cherry where we ordered our meals. The young people that brought our meals were professional & lovely.
We would definitely recommend Bentley's and next time in Clare we will be back. (by Catherine Sherrah) | Review 8: None - Staff on arrival made me feel a nuisance. Room was basic, clean touch surfaces but walls were very unattractive - old paint, old glue and maybe mould?!? Lighting ordinary. Bed was terrific, big n comfy. Bathroom clean but maybe 60s school ablution block? Concrete slabs with big cracks in walls n floor, and short curtain on shower. Location good for cafes in walking distance, but soooo noisy - traffic constant, other guests inconsiderate at 0500,0600, and staff emptying bottles/glass at 0700 into bins? Housekeeping ladies lovely! Pub smelt of deep fryers,  but local takeaway cafes were good (by Elizabeth English) | Review 9: None - Nice meal and great service by Jodie and another lady (Sorry, forgot her name) .

Seed Clare Valley,Clare,"268 Main N Rd, Clare SA 5453, Australia",Restaurant,4.4,,,,,"Review 1: 4 stars - Good food overall!
Brest tuna entree, so fresh and tasty

Ordered
Lamb patty, it was way too dry and very hard to chew and swallow it. Not recommended.
slow cooked lamb shank, very refreshing, not heavy and it didn‚Äôt have any gamy taste.
Beef schnitzel went well with the gravy $3. It was a bit hard and dry, but overall was very good!

15% surcharge on public holiday. (by Rosaline H) [5 months ago] | Review 2: 2 stars - Well, whatever you do don't order the prosciutto pizza. A big lump of cold meat with too much rocket it falls to bits in your hand. It didn't taste good either. Too much topping, simplicity is the secret.
I had a glass of wine which was nice.
Enjoyed the free iced water the most.
Atmospheric, a bad mix of soft R&B, not my thing, but yeah if you like it, run with it.
As I went to pay the waiter asked if I wanted a box for the pizza, I said no thanks that was gross. She asked me if I liked Prosciutto, I answered yes but not this style.
She asked again if I was sure I didn't want to take it. ü§Ø
I paid and left.
Very disappointed in my dining experience tbh.
Meh! (by Nicci Riley) [5 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Everytime i visit South Australia it's a must for me to visit Claire and have lunch at this gorgeous little restraunt.
I always get the prosciutto pizza it's divine and super filling. My friend had the chicken parmigiana, which was loaded she really enjoyed it, the only thing I would say is that is because there was so much ham, it needed to be left in the oven a little bit longer as some of the ham was cold.
The staff were really lovely and when I enquired about the glass of wine I had, they let me know that they had a bottle I could purchase.
I will be back and maybe I'll try something different next time. (by Rebecca Kucler) [5 months ago] | Review 4: 3 stars - Friendly service over the phone and at the front counter when ordering 2 pizzas for takeaway.
We chose BBQ Chicken and Meat lovers, the pizzas were well loaded with toppings and at $16 each to takeaway the value is amazing.
Sadly the Meat Lovers was very watery. Not sure if this came from the cheese or the tomato sauce, but it soaked through the crust and into the box below. This meant that no toppings stayed on the pizza because it was so limp. It did taste good though.
The BBQ Chicken wasn't quite as wet as the Meat lovers.
Both crusts (round the outside) were fantastic though! If the pizzas weren't as watery, this would be 6 stars. (by Dan M) [9 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Dinner for two tonight and we weren't disappointed,  lovely casual atmosphere and friendly helpful staff.

(by kirsty garnaut) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Ask about the half price special on special drinks. Take away pizzas are cheaper than dine in pizza. Great food at reasonable prices.

First time at the new location...great atmosphere and decor
Great service with friendly attentive staff
Shared a gluten free pizza which was a bit soft and dough like. I know it's not easy getting a good gluten free base but this one was not to my liking.  Topping of duck and fresh rocket with crushed walnuts and pear was superb.
The chips were amazing...crisp ,salty goodness.
Would be 5 star if not for that gluten free base.

SOUL - French Fine Dine,Clare,,Fine dining restaurant,4.5,,,,,"Review 1: 1 star - Horrible food, they don't even have a clear menu. Their prices were exorbitant.
They gave an anniversary discount which was ridiculously lower than the easy diner one, and really wonder why the so called chef has an attitude

Edit: was interesting to see the generic reply saying that they couldn't find my name in records and my review might not have been genuine. Later they had to edit their reply after uploading pictures.
I have been to Europe a couple of times and I know what European flavors are like, FYI, forget discount, would not dine at your place even for free.
I wish negative feedback can be accepted in a better way rather than trying to be assertive. Even Michelin rated
restaurants accept criticism at the end of the day. (by Preeti) [Edited a year ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Great authentic french food experience. Be aware that you get a fine dining experience. not for people who are looking for a quick bite or take out.
Food: It is authentic, so don‚Äôt expect garam masala or red mirchi or biryani. if you have ever tried food in europe, you will recognise the taste and you will love it.
Service: Fresh food takes time to make and it‚Äôs more like a personal service experience. Don‚Äôt expect waiters running around all the time. but when you need them they are right there.
Ambience: Hyderabad is used to much more rich interiors than this restaurant. I wish it was in a more earthly interior experience but none the less you will love the food.

Price: Don‚Äôt expect Paradise biryani prices here. it would cost you $$$$, but you will enjoy your meal.

I strongly recommend taking your spouse/girl friend/boyfriend or friends who would enjoy a multi course meal and take their time to enjoy their dinner.

I will definitely go back for my next dinner out. (by Sukesh Reddy) [a year ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - SOUL Fine Dine by The Butler is a (European restaurant) sets a high standard for its food quality and ensures that guests receive the same quality with every meal.

We had a four course meal and Mr.Chandan the owner of the restaurant is a absolutely amazing person how was with us and made sure we had each and everything accordingly our taste.

I have to say, I enjoyed every single bite of the meal.

I would personally like to appreciate the staff and the chef who was very friendly and made sure we were comfortable environmentally and taste wise.

Do yourself a favor and visit this lovely restaurant which has a authentic European taste in each and every bite of its dish in the menu.

(by sannithi sukavya) [2 years ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Recently got a chance to dine in here and taste the authentic european cuisine ever in Hyderabad. This place has a royal fine dine setup which is simply rich and classy. I was highly impressed with the interiors and the luminosity of this place. A perfect place for dinner dates. Mr. Chandan, the owner of this place was a perfect host and guided us through all our dishes. üòä

We started off with the delicious soup called Creme of Asparagus which was simply rich, creamy and had a blast full of perfect flavours. Highly impressed with this one. Must try for sure. ü§©

For salad we had Poached apple with blue goat cheese which was no doubt very delectable with the finest of ingredients. The sharp flavours of the goat cheese were simply on point. It really went well with the apple slices.

For the antipasto we did have two very great dishes. The Quiche de poulet being my favorite one. This was the finest and most yummiest quiche I ever had. The perfect tart with the right amount of crumble outside and cheesiest inside. Had it warm to feel the best savoury flavours of chicken with cheese and seasonings. A must try for sure. ü§© The second appetizer Prawn in jalape√±o drip was quite decent. It could have had the right amount of seasonings added, but otherwise it was surely a great starter.

For the main course I had Greek Yamista - Chicken. This dish is generally made with tomatoes or bell peppers stuffed with minced meat, veggies, cheese etc. and then baked well. I had the bell peppers one which was quite an experience. This was very fulfilling dish which lifted my mood for sure. The flavours were great and I could smell the finest quality ingredients.üòç

All the ingredients used in their kitchen are outsourced and are imported premium in quality. Also a special mention to the very patient staff, they were very well behaved and courteous. üòä

We ended our day with two of the finest desserts. Surprisingly desserts were too good. The first dessert Coffee cake was an experience in itself.  You would definitely love the dark flavours if you are a coffee lover. A very balanced dessert. üòç Colors of nature was my persp favourite dessert. Trust me it was extraordinary. Highly recommend it to everyone. A very subtle and mild one, perfect for people who are not having a sweet tooth.

I had an overall amazing experience. A must visit and worth every penny spent with your loved ones. This place will definitely make you feel special and give you the best fine dining experience. Make your reservation now and do satisfy your soul. üòä (by Ritwika Nandini Dash) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - If you are someone who wants to experience authentic western culinary then you definitely must visit Soul Fine Dine.

It‚Äôs a unique place which requires pre booking and each dish is prepared fresh after the order and customised as per one‚Äôs taste. The interior is quite classy and elegant and you get to spend quality time with your family/loved one over food.

We enjoyed their Carrot Celery Soup and Shitcan MushroomSoup which is absolutely creamy and thick. In appetizers we went with veg and chicken Quiche. It‚Äôs completely soft, buttery with a pastry crust. Do try if you love French dishes. Then came crispy chicken in Jalape√±o Dip absolutely crunchy and soft in the inside.

In main course we went ahead with Gratin Chicken, Chicken with mushroom, St Peter‚Äôs Fish in Cayenne and lastly Roasted Chicken in Cayenne. Gratin Chicken is a must try!

Colors of nature is out of the world. Along with other desserts like Soul‚Äôs chocolate Medley and Italian Coffee Cake had strong flavours of cocoa and coffee.

Overall a best experience to spend with loved ones and feel special. (by Leher Sadhnani) [Edited 2 years ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - The place is Well maintained with beautiful ambience. A rooftop dining experience with pleasant music makes your soul peaceful.

Prawns in jalape√±o, Sea bass in lemon herb sauce, Chicken pasta alfredo, chocolate meltdown were the dishes and they were great. This place is great for someone celebrating an occasion or want to surprise loved ones. There is also menu printed to the occasion. All of this was possible as Chandan ji coordinated with me in selecting the dishes and arranging all of these things. Overall it‚Äôs a great experience.

The soup was a highlight for me, as it was rich and flavorful, with a depth of taste that left me wanting more. The main course was equally impressive, with perfectly cooked meat that were prepared to perfection.

But the real star of the show was the dessert. It was a work of art, both in terms of presentation and flavor. The flavors were perfectly balanced, and the texture was divine.

Overall, it was an amazing dining experience. The ambiance was impeccable. I highly recommend this beautiful fine dining to anyone looking for a special evening out.

Well worth a visit. (by Loyes Diamonds) [3 months ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - For a quick dinner this is a very nice place. The food is good and fast prepared and served. We really enjoyed the chicken curry, chicken satay and beefburger.
The Chicken Goujons was tasting if fried in the oil for the fish and not as expected.
The chicken curry is served with rice and over de top also with Fries, who will end up cold when I have finished the curry with rice. Only rice will do.

Highly recommended! (by Emi 1111111) [a month ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Came by for a quick lunch. Seated rightaway. Service and food was served promptly. Chicken kiev was really good. Not much for the ribs. To drenched in the sweet sauce to my liking. Would prefer the classic ribs sauce or to separate the sauce. Overall an okay experience (by niken ariani) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - After the visit of the cliff of moher during the afternoon, we was looking for a bar/restaurant in the little town near to the cliff.
We found this amazing place, good atmosphere, professional service, the food was plentiful, we took the traditional fish and chips and the beef burger absolutely gorgeous !

I recommend this place for everyone wanna have a break after the walk around the cliff. (by Stocker Thomas) [5 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - This place is amazing.  The food is so DELICIOUS, and the picture of the empty plate is the evidence that it was all eaten. I loved the food, and the portion was so generous.  We went in, and all the tables were seated, but the kind owner invited us to eat at the bar section. He refused to let us go away hungry. The lovely waitress brought water immediately and she was so kind and friendly.  Lovely lady. We had  a lovely chat with the owner, who was so friendly and welcoming.  The food came in a good time.  The chicken dish was amazing, and it came with three sides (salad, chips, and coleslaw). We had lovely zero alcohol beer and Coke. My sister ordered Caesar salad, and it was so nice and fresh.  The prices were very reasonable and the food quality was really high. The place is so clean.  I highly recommend this place.  After we had our food, we enjoyed a lovely walk by the sea. (by Guitar Lady) [a year ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Food was quite good (my only note was that there were very few mushrooms in the chicken and mushroom vol au vents). The chowder was fantastic. There‚Äôs not a ton of sitting though, so be prepared to wait 20-30 min during busy hours. The servers were great and helped speed along the process as we waited for a table to open up.

We were pleasantly surprised by the delicious food and great prices. After eating lots of pub food throughout our trip in Ireland, it was refreshing to have some different flavours. (by Gabrielle Tayag) [a year ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - The rumors are true I guess.

Generally poor experience from whenever I have gone here.
Compared to the location on the Gort road there is a huge decline in food consistency and service.
Both times I've been forgotten at the table for ordering and had poorly made Green Tea served shockingly late at the end of my meal when I can't really drink it.

I would highly recommend the location on the gort road over this, both times I've had a poor experience which has left me miffed to say the least having to pay. (by Noah Clare) [2 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Excellent street food!
In our travels through Ireland, we‚Äôve often found it hard to experience gluten free food with spice. Not spicy, but full of spices. Our experience at LANA was quite the opposite. My daughter and I had Pad Thai with prawns and chicken as well as a crispy chicken with chili. They had gluten free soy sauce and an array of dishes for those with celiac. It was a bit of a bus ride but well worth it. And there was gluten free Italian food across the street as well. Such a find. (by Dale Huntington) [3 years ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - I saw someone walk out with a spicy box and I told my wife I need to get one because I was craving fries.  My wife looked at me and thought I was crazy because she thought I would be disappointed especially when most of their clients on a Friday afternoon is a bunch of teeny boppers.  i went in to order one among a throng (at least 50) of screaming 12-16 year olds.  It was maddening and chaotic.  The inside was very well decorated especially a wall art with expertly arranged bowls.  I appreciate the staff getting me food in under 10 minutes and handled all these loud young adults with expertise and professionalism.  It was admirable.  I appreciate the spicy box for what it is.  A perfect execution of a fast food dish with fries, fried chicken, and some vegetable garnishes slathered in a soy/thai chili sauce (wife thinks it was light Sichuan).  It was decent.  Appreciate you brightening our day. (by Chino Leong) [a month ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Got into this place randomly. Ordered chicken tom yum soup, chicken chow mein and fried dumplings.

Goosers Bar & Eating House,Clare,"Ballina, Co. Tipperary, V94 R678, Ireland",Restaurant,4.4,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 5 stars - We stopped here for a late lunch after hiking in the area. It quickly turned into an early dinner because the menu was quite appetising.
We ordered chicken wings to share for a starter. For main I had the day's special mussels and prawns in a tomato creamy sauce and my husband had the traditional fish and chips. And for dessert we had pear and almond tart and brownie.
While all of the dishes were tasty, the star of the meal was my main. The seafood was cooked in the most amazing sauce, it tasted very homemade. And all the food had an impeccable presentation.
The service was second to none, all the staff was friendly and polite without being too intrusive. They brought out 2 natural treats for our dog and filled the water bowl for her too. We dined outside on the terrace, but I asked and they dogs are welcome inside too. They have a dedicated dining room where people can dine with their pets.

The service was amazing as well, staff were very polite and happy to help. (by Lauryn Denby) [6 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Old Lodge Gastric Pub is a simple looking pub with a deception gastric element that is... very  good. The simply ""Duck"" starter on the menu is not only pretty in its presentation but very tasty and light. Duck on a bed of greens layered with firm pliable lentils and a creamy curry sauce, not over much, not over powering and the portion size was satisfying. *****
Chicken wings lightly battered, tossed in a tangy spicy, not to hot bbq sauce with a house made aoli garlic sauce. Just yummy.
The mains came  and the fish and chips, gluten-free batter was light buttery and a perfect match to the haddock. The dill sauce wS light had some vinegar, and lemon was the perfect company I on to the fish. I was a little confused by the other sauce, having tried it.
The tapas plate was sausages, chicken spicy wings, and fresh with dill and aoli sauce. All excellent. This is a gem in Shannon.
The service was excellent, and all servers were polite and attentive. Very helpful with the menu as I am gluten free all allergens were listed next to the dishes.
The atmosphere is relaxed with 80s- 90s music playing.  The decore is modern and goes well, not overpowering. Children are welcome here as well.

All excellent. This is a gem in Shannon. I am visiting and will return on my next visit. (by Pat Semi) [a year ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - Had a seperate vegan menu,  with 3 options for each course. Very unique to have that th is side of the country.

Got the nacho starter which was delicious but did not come with melted cheese. Servers didn't even tell us it was missing cheese nor tried to offer a substitution.

Got the burger.. which is a potato spinach burger, nice to have something different to plant meats so was happy with that. bun was subbed for another bun, again, without talking to us about it.

The orange chocolate cake was absolutely delicious! (by Arie A) [a year ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - The food was decent, worthy of a 3-star rating, but I couldn‚Äôt justify giving it a 4. I ordered the house special‚Äîlamb shank with mashed potatoes, gravy, and a side of carrots and turnips. The food arrived on time, which was a plus. However, the lamb was a bit tough, and while the shank looked substantial, there wasn‚Äôt as much meat as I‚Äôd expected. The portion size was reasonable, but the flavor could‚Äôve been more refined. Also got a Pino Grigio for 27‚Ç¨ have had better at much cheaper price.

For dessert, I had the apple crumble with custard and an apple tart. The portion sizes felt small for the price. The apple crumble, in particular, was disappointing‚Äîit was steaming hot in the middle and cold on the outside, clearly microwaved, and almost burnt my mouth.

Later, I ordered room service, which I‚Äôd rate around 6.5/10‚Äîconsistent with the restaurant experience.

Would I return to the restaurant if I weren‚Äôt staying at the hotel? Honestly, probably not.

We got the chicken sandwich, the goat cheese with added chicken, the OG and one of us made our own. The goats cheese was very sparse on the cheese and the OG was very skimpy on the meat. Food was brought out and the waiters didn‚Äôt know what the orders were. Overall overpriced including the coffee. I gave it 4 as there was a busker there who was quite good. (by Aisling Burke) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - Disappointing
The slices of bread were too thick on the BLT and OG ( ham, cheese, tomato and onion). As a result the sandwiches did not melt well and were only lukewarm , with the "" Considiine's"" bread overpowering the contents, which was a shame as the ham was nice.  Even the bread lover left a third of his bread. It was nice and healthy that there was salad on the side but with no dressing the onions and green peppers were too sharp to finish  eating
The young staff were pleasant and working hard but overall a bit disorganised with lack of clear directions as another reviewer mentioned.
This was supposed to be brunch but will now actuallyhave to get lunch in some other town as we travel the beautiful west Clare coast.

This little gem of a restaurant was getting ready to close but kindly offered to stay open and serve our family.  Food was really good, upscale pub fare. Clean, neat, restaurant with outdoor seating. (by Steve Fisher) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - I went there with my mum for late lunch, it was very goof and the food came in a good time speed. We ordered carbonara and one portion of chips. It was good but the only thing I didn't like that one plate was full and the other wasn't,  there is no consistency in portion sizes. Also,  the chips portion was a bit smaller than usual,  but it was crispy and delicious.  The waitress was good and served us two large glasses of water with loads of ice. It was so refreshing for a hot day.  My overall experience is good and I will ho again. The carbonara was so good and we ordered one to take away. Also the garlic bread was good, it was on the perfect side, the size was good, and flavoured well. I would like to ho again and try more, the prices were also reasonable. (by Guitar Lady) [a year ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - We were on our way from the cliffs of Moher to Sligo on a Wednesday night when we found this little gem of a restaurant on the way. When we walked in there was only 2 other couples there and it remained that way for the entirety of our meal. The restuarant was nicely decorated and roomy. We were told by the kind server we can sit wherever. For drinks we ordered an Orchard Thieves and my partner ordered the special drink which was a Strawberry Gin Fizz. The speciality drink was delicious and an okay deal at 10 euros. Since being an Ireland, we have been trying all the fish and chips along our route. So of course we tried the fish and chips here. The food came out quickly and was hot. The fish and chips definitely were the best we have come across thus far since visiting Kilkenny, Limerick, and Mayo. The star of the meal was the lamb loin which was on dinner special that night at what we thought was 15.5 euros. The dish is one I would eat again and again if I could. It had cut crispy onions on top of lamb loin which was on top of a bed of mashed potatoes. On the side there were peas, stuffing, and pureed squash. It was all so delicious and we finished every last bite since we hadn't eaten since the morning. If I was staying in Ennis and not just passing through I would have gone back the next day for lunch. If you are in Ennis or passing through take time to stop here it is worth the time. (by Karina Pacchioni) [8 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - ü´ïü•£üçßüç∞   I love this restaurant and bar, it's just extraordinary... I think this is the best place in Ennis!
True, I underestimated its modest facade and often passed by it in the center of Ennis... But after I visited here for the first time  , this is my love forever. ü•∞
You can sit inside or outside, I love outside, with a cozy fence you are separated from the bustle of the city and at the same time you are in the very center.
Unlike huge portions in other restaurants, which I do not eat myself,  here the serving is very refined and at the same time everything is very tasty, beautiful, satisfying and appetizing!
Vegan and vegetarian menus are also available here. Dairy-free mango ice cream with warm apple crumble and a light cream sauce won my heart.  ‚ù§ I didn't even notice that the ice cream is dairy-free. An excellent combination of cold and warm may not appeal to your teeth, but the taste is excellent.
Served piping hot. Friendly staff, very pleasant place, I recommend!ü•Çüçæ (by Iryna Z) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - I can‚Äôt say enough.  It‚Äôs a wonderful place.  Great food, great value, and great service.

The quantity is also decent enough. Easy to locate and have enough parking space. (by Shaadhanaa) [a year ago] | Review 3: 1 star - I had the worst experience at this restaurant, despite going there based on recommendations.
I ordered the Kolhapuri, but it was extremely spicy. I approached the manager and told him I wouldn‚Äôt be able to eat it due to the spice level. Instead of addressing the issue himself, he sent a staff member who told me, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt eat that, you can order something else.‚Äù I asked for a replacement, but they refused to do so.
I also ordered Gulab Jamun and waited for 15 minutes. When I went to ask about my order, they told me the kitchen was closed.

I would not recommend this restaurant at all especially if you're Indian. It was the worst experience.

To make things worse, they still charged me the full amount for the dish, even though it wasn‚Äôt my fault. Honestly, if I were white, I believe they would have handled the situation differently. While I was told the kitchen was closed, they continued to serve another customer sitting at a nearby table.

Extremely disappointing service. (by Apurva Daphale) [a month ago] | Review 4: 1 star - Worst restaurant experience ever.
Zero stars.
Ordered a meal where we asked for no onions, low and behold there was half a bag of onions in it when we got it.
Rang and explained the issue, took 45 mins before they delivered another meal. Yet again, it arrived with a load of onions.
Naan breads were burnt and half cold.
Save yourself the hassle and avoid. (by Frank Nixon) [a month ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Highly recommend this restaurant. By far the best restaurant to get Indian food in the area. All of the parts of the dishes were excellent - I ordered the Egg Fried Rice, Garlic/Onion/Coriander Naan and Lamb Phall. All elements of the dishes were excellent with exceptional flavour. The spices of all dishes can be customised to order and the staff are very friendly.  The restaurant itself is a nice space and a luxury experience with a great selection of dishes and sides - would definitely recommend if in the area. (by Sean Kelly) [3 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Having grown up around the Balti houses in Birmingham, I can sometimes be a bit fussy about Indian food.
Any time spent walking near the restaurant in Shannon, you will be welcomed by faint smells of delicious Indian cuisine that will only make the mouth water... The House Balti dish was stunning! Full of flavour, texture and fabulous aroma.
Cannot recommend highly enough! (by Brock Lagan) [6 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Excellent customer service and super delicious authentic Indian Food. Love the ambience, food  and the service provided by the staff. We had come from India for a month and we ate everyday at Bollywood temple. Whether you are from India or not and loveto enjoy good food you must visit Bollywood Temple. Thank you for the great food.üôÇ (by Vimis Pagare) [3 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - The taste and quality of food is the best so far in Clare. We have been to Indian restaurants in Ennis and Limerick but still we find this place better than all of the other places. Taste is consistent most of the times but may vary a bit sometimes. Garlic naan is the most recommended. If you love spiciness, then Paneer kolhapuri is good choice, for mid spice, Paneer karahi and Methi chaman (even less spicer). I gave all the options in Paneer since I am vegetarian but you can get non-veg option as well. I hope this helps you make a choice. Thanks. (by Purvesh Gajjar) [3 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - I can rate this place as the best Indian restaurant in Clare. Both vegetarian and non vegetarian menu is awesome.

The Olive Tree Restaurant,Clare,"8 George's Quay, Englishtown, Limerick, Ireland",Restaurant,4.4,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Wow, Wow, Wow!!!
Last night we had the tasting menu for the Flavours of Limerick culinary event, and it was just fantastic.

Each course was designed to have a Limerick Latin twist which was the theme of the night. The wines were expertly paired with each course and there was and explanation of this as you recorded each glass. The chef also came to explain the components of each dish which was a highlight of the evening.

Our favourite dish was the first course. Every element of the taco was bursting with flavour. But there has to be a mention for the ribeye which was cooked (medium rare) to perfection. We forgot to take a picture of desert as we dived in once it was explained to us.

The atmosphere was buzzing with all tables full and the DJ setting the scene. The music was never too loud but was a great addition.

The whole experience was excellent value at ‚Ç¨60 pp. If this was on every month I would come. (by Aine Smith) [2 weeks ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - No doubt the best restaurant in Limerick.

We loved the decor, it seems higher end aesthetic wise. The service was great. We had 3 different servers who were all attentive and friendly and professional. Food was great, somewhat Greek or middle eastern ish. A nice appetizer of hummus , baba ganoush with freshly made pitas. Wine was lovely as were the stemware, it makes a big difference. Dinner was pork belly and seafood risotto, both excellent üëå They even offered us a little treat of corn on a stick with a nice spice on them. A+++ 5 star.

The seafood chowder was also very good. (by Lisa McAfee) [2 weeks ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Atmosphere:
Local pub. Lively in the front of the pub. We were well greeted when we walked in. It was cool to see the law enforcement patches from around the world (mostly US).

Staff:
We received very warm welcome at the door. We were asked by 2 different people if we needed to take our order. After finishing our food, it did take a while to get our check. The pub did start getting a bit more busy.

Burger:
The bread was toasted to perfection with light butter and crispy edges. The bread was soft on the inside. The burger itself was okay. They do have regular mustard (American Mustard) if you ask. The French fries were amazing! This was the first place I had fries that were shaped like potatoes chips but airy and cooked like French fries.

Beef Stew:
The stew was very good. The beef was tender and very flavorful. It came with two hearty scoops of mashed potatoes. It came with soda bread that was great also.

I had the pot of mussels for dinner, they were ok, the flavour was good but they were on the small side compared to what other local restaurants were serving. My husband had the roast beef dinner which he didn‚Äôt enjoy at all.
Besides that, the staff are really nice and friendly, so welcoming and accommodating and the atmosphere is great so definitely stop in for a drink.
They also have a really cool beer garden area outback that backs onto a little river, it‚Äôs really pretty. (by Clare Mercer) [2 weeks ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Great local pub with all the flair you expect of an Irish Pub! We visited on St. Patrick's  Day! The place was super busy, but everyone worked hard to make sure people were taken care of at the bar and tables. we did the Beef Stew and the Fish and Chips and weren't disappointed. If you are in Doolin, or in the area for the Aran Islands or Cliffs of Moher, then stop in to this pub for a pint and a great food and service. (by Steve Holmes) [6 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - I cannot recommend McGann‚Äôs enough! Our group was staying in the area and heard about this pub. We stopped for dinner and a pint. The beef stew was delicious! The pub was very busy, however, the staff were friendly and were working hard to accommodate every group. Because of how crowded it was, we were seated with another couple and became friends with them throughout dinner. They also have live music every night at 9. Definitely stop by if you are in Doolin!!

Conveniently located in the village of Doolin. (by Yongmei Zhang) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 2 stars - We came across this last night in Doolin on 23/08/25
We ordered 5 pizzas, which weren't great at all.. They used cheap bases, and all 5 people thought they weren't great.  That was a mixture of children and adults.
I had ordered the Riverside chicken..
Which was the last to come out by about 10 minutes +++
The dinner was presented well, but when I cut into it.. the chicken was raw..
I called the waitress over, and she said I'll bring it to the kitchen, and they'll sort it out.
I said no thanks üòí I don't want it now.
I spoke to the manager..
Who said they were trying to get all the food out together, and they were doing their best. But I said the chicken was completely raw in the middle, and I could I have gotten very sick . Not once did the manager or waitress apologise. They said I was very aggressive.. which is not through .
I never complain üòå but I obviously had to on this occasion.
I would not recommend this restaurant ever..in fact ..I'm surprised it's still opened
.please don't eat here. (by Margaret Jeffers) [a month ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - This restaurant is a gem!  Our food was delicious and the atmosphere quaint. We had the seafood trio, pizza, lamb, and ribs and everyone loved their food. We wish we were staying longer so we could eat here again. (by Whitney McKinstry) [a month ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - We stumbled upon this place by accident on our trip in May, and it turned out to be the best meal in our entire two week trip to Ireland. Delicious food, gorgeous plating, and great value for the price. Ireland as a whole is not cheap, but this place truly felt like a bargain compared to most of the other meals we had on the island. We tend to go for a little more ""upscale,"" having lived in a ""foodie"" town for the last few years, and this fit the bill for us.

The atmosphere was so cozy, and the husband and wife team were excellent. The husband was in the back cooking all the food, and the wife was up front serving with the most genuine smile you've ever seen. Would recommend this place to anyone. (by Rebecca Donohue) [2 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - The food was fantastic! The presentation was great. The service was awesome. It was a little restaurant but was worth every euro spent!

Coffee was good and an excellent cheese scone hit the spot. Cafe atmosphere and location is perfect. Very enjoyable.

Water bowls out for dogs, of which there are many. (by Paul Godden) [a year ago] | Review 3: 1 star - Absolutely shocking experience. Two young girls were sold raw sausage rolls and when they asked for help, they were told they ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt have bought them‚Äù and refused a refund. Other customers even checked the rolls, agreed they were raw, and kindly gave the girls money to buy food elsewhere. When I went back in as an adult, the man working there called the girls liars, argued, and even tried to pass off a fresh sausage roll as theirs. He laughed when I said the girls felt intimidated. Extremely unprofessional and intimidating behaviour. Only 1 star because he eventually gave me the refund.

¬£6 gets you a toasted sandwich that is burnt, tasteless and tiny. You get 4 crisps and a few leaves with it.

One bite and I sent it back for a refund.

The pesto was an untastable scraping, the tomatoes were few, pale and tasteless slices, not actually sun dried, the mozzarella was the only real ingredient and there was very little.

No one else in the party enjoyed their food, tho mine was the only one that was inedible.

The wait staff seemed frustrated and disinterested.

We reported it to the trainee waitress who took it away back to the kitchen and did not return to our table once to apologise or anything and completly ignored us after.

They must have sprayed fly spray as there was another dead fly on the table. When we requested the bill from another waitress the fish was still on it and I explained the situation again and she said she would let a manager know. The fish was removed from the bill but we felt they didnt believe that the fly was in the food even though the trainee waitress saw it and carried it still on the plate crawling back to the kitchen!!!
Management should have came and apologised and we tried to get their attention times but were ignored - very poor service for the price. Will not be returning.

The staff are as very friendly and knowledgeable of the food choices available.

Being wet and cold from the outing to the Cliffs, the generous portions were just what we needed to end a perfect outing.

The Vanilla and Rhubarb pudding was THE absolute best -although my daughter‚Äôs Gluten-free Brownie gave it a proper run for 1st place. Both were perfectly accompanied by their delicious coffee.

Completely fooled by online recommendations. Look at the state of the starter, an absolute joke for the price they charge. Noodles drenched in oil (we only managed one spoon) and the ‚ÄúSzechuan beef‚Äù was the worst I‚Äôve ever had. ‚Ç¨5 for the cheapest store-bought ice cream is just insulting.

It‚Äôs frustrating how some places think charging ‚Ç¨65 for two adults means customers shouldn‚Äôt expect quality. Staff made minimal effort. First and last visit.

Great service, (our server Liz was beyond great!) with that being said the food service was a little slow but not due to the service staff or kitchen... they were slammed, working hard and not stopping!

Centrally located with a charming dynamic pub...make this place your home away from home when in Ireland. (by patricia delorey) | Review 6: None - We spent a week in Ennis earlier this month and stayed at the Old Ground.
Its location is perfect in town centre. Walkable distance from most attractions, including a lovely beauty salon just cross the road (Beautique).
The service is professional and friendly, at the reception and in the restaurant/bar. The poet's corner is great to relax after an excursion, to meet friend or to enjoy quality time with family. The food is good and good value.
My partner forgot a hanger with a jacket. We called the hotel reception, they took our details and a few days later, the jacket was home. The address tags on the packaging had been typed on a computer in big letters, telling a lot about their attention to detail.
The rooms are nice, very clean however, in our room the bathroom just had a big bathtub with a shower inside (working perfectly). We didn't mind but someone with limited mobility could find it hard to access the shower.
We were in the 229, room on O'Connell street. The night is calm but in the morning on week days a council cleaning car is beeping shortly after 8.

I found Vaughan's online and booked the venue before we even saw it due to living in the states. When we were able to go over, a year before our wedding date, they happily organized our tasting. As time grew closer to our date, they were easy to communicate with and so very flexible!
The day of our wedding- it was evident how much Vaughan's cared about making our big day feel special. They managed moving the ceremony inside seamlessly (since it was raining, of course lol), and our food was absolutely delicious! We still are receiving compliments from guests about how great the food was.
Every step of the way Vaughan's staff was kind, enthusiastic, and easy to work with. I cannot recommend hosting your wedding here enough.

The team are fantastic, especially Triona, who handled all communications and requests, nothing was an issue, and she was just so helpful. The food is amazing, we were blown away at the food tasting, which they kindly didn‚Äôt mind my parents attending also, and again at the wedding all the guests were raving about how good the food was! Everything went very smoothly and that is down to how organised the team is. The barn is such a gorgeous, intimate place and the perfect place for a smaller wedding (we had around 90 guests.) We gave the white table plan easel pictured to Vaughan‚Äôs as a token of our thanks, so it‚Äôs there for other couples to use. The accommodation provided is also excellent, very clean and comfortable. Overall would highly recommend Vaughan‚Äôs for a wedding.

Excellent large parking lot right behind the bar. Very convenient. (by Alexander SpecLED) [a month ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Vaughans Pub helped give us a wedding reception we will never forget - and in short time, too! We looked everywhere for a place that would host a small wedding reception (12 people), but still have a private place to offer for sitting. Not only did Vaughans deliver a room, they went above and beyond - from the decorations they provided, customized menus with our names, holding our wedding cake and then displaying it beautifully - we are so incredibly appreciative. The food was good (recommend their hot wings in particular, and the fish and chips meals were enjoyed by all who got them, with big fish portions and crunchy breading), but the highlight for us was the space. A private room with candles all around, decorative fairy lights, bubbly laid out on a table for us for toasting - we can't say enough about the work they put in to give us a magical and memorable reception.

Our guests were full of praise for the food, and the barn setup for the dinner was absolutely perfect. One of the many highlights of the day was having our first dance outside‚Äîit was such a special moment and beautifully done.

Huge thanks to all the staff who worked so hard on the day and night. Special shoutout to Luke and Caitlin who were everywhere over the few days, and their care and attention to detail made us feel completely at ease that everything was taken care of.

We booked to go to Mr Mick. I am glad we did, it was busy.

It's a lovely place to sit, cold but it smelt good in there. So if you weren't hungry,  you would be once you had smelt the food.
We ordered lots of plates. I hate tapas. This is obviously not really tapas food.
We decided to have our bread and arancini first. The arancini was good. Bread is so small. Onto the chicken, which was average- not exciting. My husband said the lamb was good. The carrots were ok but mash looked like it had come from a packet.
Chips ok. Salad very good, dressing was very good.
We choose the special for dessert. It was the highlight.
The food was good. But not fabulous.
Wine was ok. Again nothing to get excited about.
The service was average!
Three people working,  well only one person really working on the floor. The amazing Miss V.
The other two were hopeless.
While Miss V spun around a million times, the other two were clumsy and inefficient.
Total bill $177-
Wine included.

No.

Biggest disappointment aside from the carb overload was the aioli with the potato, was wishing this was sour cream.

Cellar door was also great and after a tasting paddle we chose a Riesling. (by R) [2 months ago] | Review 6: 1 star - Today was my daughter‚Äôs 30th birthday celebration. Eight of us came with great expectations to Mr Micks, with Sophie having always wanted to eat here.
I‚Äôm afraid all eight of us were very surprised at how disappointing our experience was.
1. Sophie had asked for a paired chefs choice and only received one glass of wine.
2. The food was at best reasonable pub food, served mildly warm with the majority of it being fried. Having said that the seared tuna was fresh and the most enjoyed by all.
3. When enquiring if Sophie would receive a dairy free option when the remaining guests had deep fried halloumi we were told ‚Äúno‚Äù as the capsicum dish would be too filling for her and the previous dish was the equivalent of two. That being a mushroom with couscous on it and a handful of salad greens and not at all appetising. Then we were curtly told they‚Äôd bring something out‚Ä¶a bowl of more salad greens with lukewarm bok choy served with canned coconut cream which was vile.
4. The pork belly was very tough and not crunchy and left by most. Most of the food was barely seasoned.
5. The staff were not attentive. When asked if we could please have another high chair on arrival, we were told I have one for you. I don‚Äôt know if we can do something with the pram though, we weren‚Äôt expecting that.
There was barely a smile and plates were not cleared. We honestly felt as though we were an inconvenience.
We were asked once if we‚Äôd like more water with one bottle given for 8. Not asked if we‚Äôd like dessert or any other wine.
6. There was no explanation of the dishes we were being served. Certainly not what we have experienced with past ‚Äúchef choice dining ‚Äú.  And we‚Äôre not a bunch of ‚ÄúKaren‚Äôs‚Äù. We are a very easy going bunch and love to be with each other.
7. $63. We should have left when we first arrived and discerned it was not a welcoming place. This was something we had all saved for and really wanted it to be memorable for Soph. We‚Äôre having a bit of laugh now because it really was memorable but for all the wrong reasons.
8. When paying for the bill they tried to charge us for the pairing and then didn‚Äôt quite believe us when we said she had only received one glass.

So sad I can‚Äôt be more positive with this review.

As an addition to our review I would like to thank the manager and staff for their quick response and kindness  they showed to us today when I came to meet them. They were very apologetic, listened intently and  were very generous in making up for our experience yesterday.  Sincerely‚Ä¶thank you. (by Sarah Chalmers) [Edited 2 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - We had a car rental for the day and our travel agent had listed this winery in our suggestions to visit for the day. So glad we did. We stopped in the cellar before the restaurant opened and got to sample a few wines. Staff was super nice and friendly. We had the chef's selection for lunch. Seriously one of the best meals we had on our entire trip! We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and I highly recommend visiting! (by Courtney Ward) [2 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Came for lunch and ordered the squid, arancini, duck and soft shell crab (not pictured). I highly recommend the squid, it is just the right balance between crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! Food was served at a decent pace and service staff were very friendly. Would come back again :-) (by Steffany XY) [a year ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Me & the hubby decided to grab a late lunch after hitting the Riesling Trail and this spot was perfect. What can I say the Tapas were to die for. The young lass that served us recommended how many dishes she thought we might like to order depending on how hungry we were so we opted for 5 but I think we had eyes bigger than our belly‚Äôs as the portion sizes were surprisingly big and jam packed full of flavour. The hubby found the perfect wine, Mr Mick Shiraz so much so he decided to buy an extra couple of bottles to bring home.
The staff were really nice and very friendly who all seem to make it run like clockwork our tapas dishes came out at a steady rate and we didn‚Äôt feel rushed, it was a really relaxing dining experience thank you üòä this place is a hidden gem & I would definitely recommend it (by lisa stephenson) [a year ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Another fantastic meal.

Linnane's Lobster Bar,Clare,"Ballyvelaghan, New Quay, Co. Clare, Ireland",Seafood restaurant,4.6,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - This restaurant was a random find. We just wanted to catch the sunset and we found this restaurant down the same road we happened to turn down. The oysters were absolutely memorable. Wow-just wow. The mignonette was so flavorful and was a great pairing. The chowder with the loaf/bread was incredible. Chock full of different seafood and so delicious. The restaurant was in a picturesque location. The restaurant was really too warm but I suppose if that‚Äôs the worst thing-it‚Äôs really not worth a mention. (by Bethany Etheridge) [a week ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - An unforgettable seafood experience at Linnane‚Äôs!

Stopped in to Linnane‚Äôs Lobster Bar in New Quay around midday and was lucky to be seated without a booking ‚Äî though I‚Äôd absolutely recommend calling ahead during busy times, as this place is deservedly popular.

The seafood was nothing short of spectacular. You can taste the freshness in every bite. I had lobster that had been caught the very same morning ‚Äî sweet, tender, and perfectly cooked. The shellfish platter was equally impressive: oysters, mussels, and crab, all fresh from the sea and beautifully prepared.

Of course, everything goes down best with a creamy pint of Guinness, and Linnane‚Äôs pours a perfect one. I also have to shout out the brown bread ‚Äî hands down the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. Dense, nutty, and still warm from the oven, it was the perfect companion to the shellfish and chowder.

The setting only adds to the magic ‚Äî stunning views over the water and the surrounding countryside make it a joy to sit and linger. Whether you‚Äôre a local or just passing through, this place is a gem not to be missed. Can‚Äôt wait to return! (by Loyes Diamonds) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Some of the best oysters I‚Äôve ever had. Grilled lobster was delicious. To top it off they pour a fantastic and creamy pint of Guinness. Only thing missing was maybe some proper napkins‚Ä¶lobster got a bit messy üòÖ (by Rebecca G) [a week ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - I love a good seafood chowder and was on something of a mission to try as many as I could in Ireland on this trip.  Linnane‚Äôs Lobster Bar served up the absolute best of all: smoked salmon, hake, haddock, cod, carrots, celery, rich creamy base.
Brown bread (Irish soda bread) that came with the chowder was excellent. (by Conor O'Mahony) [a month ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Such a great mix in this seafood platter; fresh, juicy, and full of flavour! ü¶ûü¶êü¶™

(by Ammy C Warny) [a month ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - We shared the lobster, giant prawns, calamari and some bread. Honestly wish we had ordered more. The potatoes that came with the lobster were so crispy. The prawns were a little on the spicy side. My son ate all the calamari so I assume it was delicious. It does get messy so they do offer you a finger bowl to clean off your hands. (by Nichelle S) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Fantastic food - some of the best we've every tasted.

Our group had the steak, lobster, and seafood platter for two. Steak and lobster meals were perfect, the seafood platter had clams, mussel's, shrimp, and lobster. I have had mussels and clams before and was not the biggest fan but these clams and mussels were out of this world. Changed my whole perspective on both. Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever have as tasty or fresh (the were bringing them in from the ocean as we ate) clams or mussels again but wow!!! (by Jeff and Kim) [4 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - The perfect stop during our trip around the island!

Walked in & was fretted by Rufus who was polite & very professional & knowledgable about the menu (including nut allergies)

We had a few rounds of oysters & loved them, the buttermilk granita was a nice touch & so were the garlic!

Mussels were tasty with a great brother & the soda bread dipped was perfect

Fish and chips was good! Mushy peas needed some seasoning

The view is spectacular & all in all it was a wonderful visit & stop (by Brian Duffy) [3 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Holy COW!!! Linnane‚Äôs was amazing!! We were craving a nice local and fresh seafood spot on our way back to Dublin. We looked up some things on the map and this came up! We parked our car across from a field of cows and walked in. There were no tables available really, but they accommodated us in a little counter space against a window which worked out fine!

Were started with some special blood orange Oysters, which were local Flaggy Shore and SO fresh and tasty. We also did the seafood chowder and garlic crab claws. They use a Brown Crab I believe, which is kind of like a stone crab that we have in Florida, but served hot. DELICIOUS!!

Main course was a seafood pasta and grilled Hake. Both amazing. I can‚Äôt say enough great things about Linnane‚Äôs! I would come back here in a heart beat. This was some of the freshest seafood I‚Äôve had in a long time. They literally have the oysters coming in right there! Highly recommend.

Had, home made Scotch egg starter, the steak, ale and blue cheese pie served with seasonal veg, roast potatoes and Yorkshire pudding (part of Sunday menu) and the Creme Brulee.

Highlights were the pie itself lots of steak and a lovely rich flavour and the roast potatoes were excellent, crispy, well seasoned and fluffy inside.

2 local guest cask ales were on from Pumphouse community brewery in nearby Toppesfield (oktoberfest style ale) and from Nethergate brewery in Long Melford ( a red ale for Halloween)

Food again is great and worth the price. Staff were friendly. The atmosphere was relaxed and cozy.

(by Louis A) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - The online reviews were a bit older but I can report that as of August 2025 Pipers is excellent. Between the 5 of us we had mushroom starter (amazing), soup, duck, salmon, and lamb and it was all perfect, couldn't ask for better. Great service, and the back of house is doing great work. Best meal we've had in County Clare in a long time.
Giving 4 stars instead of 5 for atmosphere because security cameras feel a little under the eye of big brother but it's standard practice everywhere these days.
Definitely worth the trip and thanks to the staff for a great evening! (by Jeffrey Knight) [a month ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - Absolutely surprisingly flavorful foods! In the midst of what seems to be a bit of a sleepy town, we rolled into the Peppermill after 8 on a Friday night to find ourselves among three birthday celebrations clearly enjoying both friendly environment and delicious meals.

We didn‚Äôt drink, so our bill reflects just 2 mains and a pavlova dessert (interestingly sort of stuffed with a cream) and totaled ‚Ç¨65. We had two dinners featuring fish fillets. Both were layered with nuanced flavor and were presented beautifully. The bake was especially interesting and prepared perfectly. We considered going back the next night.

Like all the places we ate in Ireland, once you‚Äôve got your food, the staff forgets you, even to the point of having to chase someone down to pay. This adds a bit of downtime to one‚Äôs meal, even if it is them trying not to rush you. (by c hart) [a month ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Best restaurant we've been to on our trip to Ireland so far. Friendly staff, big portions and delicious food. The seafood chowder especially is not only the best seafood chowder we've had in Ireland (every place makes it a bit different) but it's one of the tastiest meals I've ever eaten.

The mushroom and truffle arrinchini was delicious and the veal was amazing.

The kids meal was very large but also yummy my son enjoyed it.

Margeretta pizza was divine. Had the good cheese not just shredded cheese and also had basil on the pizza.

My partner had the linguine seafood pasta dish he said that he couldn't taste the seafood and there wasn't many prawns or crab meat but was still lovely.

I had the risotto with sausage and pumpkin. It was lovely and the texture for me was perfect it wasn't gluggy.

Two lovely glasses of Italian wine, one a lovely Prosecco and then a rose with our mains. We started with burratta with prosciutto which we shared.  It was beautifully creamy and had a lovely caramelised balsamic dressing and basil leaves. Then two delicious mains, Ragu with pasta and polenta with prawns, fish and calamari in a tomato sauce. Both were excellent. A tiramisu to finish was lovely.
Another excellent meal at Ragu, and we would highly recommend this restaurant. (by wendy adams) [6 months ago] | Review 6: 1 star - The mushroom truffle gnocchi was absolutely flavourless.  I‚Äôve had better gnocchi from a frozen meal.   Food was returned and we left due to having no confidence that any of their food would be worth trying.
- An addition to this review.   The owner claims the meal was packed with umami - I have eaten at many Italian restaurants around the world and have never had a gnocchi that was so tasteless and watery.   He even agreed that there was something wrong with the dish when he tried it after taking it back. (by Kym Hobbs) [Edited 2 weeks ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Authentic Italian Restaurant and Pizzeria. A warm and inviting ambience inside. Upon arrival, we were escorted to our Table, close to the slow combustion fire. Just perfect ! The Menu selection has authentic Italian cuisine but also various other Dishes and Pizza as well. Prices are average and fair ( mid $30's on average for Mains)  You can find their Menu online. Wine and Spirit selection is good. We had the Shiraz and the Italian Prosecco which was beautifully light on the palette and bursting with plenty of bubbles.  On my shopping list for sure !
We ordered the ""Maccheroni AL Rag√π Napoletano"" (slow cooked chunky beef and pork ragu in a rich tomato sauce) which had a generous amount of chunky meat I must say which impressed us both and the ""Ravioli di Granchio""  (house made Ravioli with fresh SA blue swimmer Crab, confit cherry Tomato and fresh dill)  ... they were
both authentic Italian and absolutely delicious !
The Service was friendly and very attentive both evenings we dined.  On the first evening before leaving, a friendly gentleman by the name of Salvatore that we had seen many times busily attending to Patrons during the evening, genuinely asked us if we were happy with everything and our reply... 10/10.  We look forward to returning to Clare soon and Ragu Restaurant will be the first place we will be sure to re-book.  A credit to everyone from the bottom to the top, including young Rory who was our Waiter both evenings we visited. His cheerful banter was lovely, along with his sharp, attentive Service.  Well done all, including the talented Chefs and others in the background that synergistically make this place great !  üëèüëèüëè (by Michele Miers) [Edited a year ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - Very nice authentic Italian restaurant in Clare valley.
The food was very nice but not amazing but probably the best around the area.
The sommelier Salvatore helped us a lot in choosing the best wines to go with our food.

If you're in Clare valley this is probably one of the best restaurants that you can find. (by Fabio Gesmundo) [a year ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Stopped at Ragu&Co in Clare for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and had a great experience. Was warmly welcomed by Romolo the owner and his staff.
The menu was a great selection of antipastas, entrees, mains and desserts. They even had a selection of pizzas.

We were seated at a 2 top and the only ones sitting in that area. The lunch menu is just the right mix with pizza, pasta, salads, and sandwiches. We ordered Panuzzi's that are similar to a calzone except a tortilla style crust folded in half. The crust was crunchy with just the right amount of filling and cheese. It was served on a cutting board with a small mixed greens salad. The atmosphere was like being in someone's crowded basement. Though it was a clever idea selling decorative items such as lighting.

(by Auksita Jaro) [a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - I was in Killaloe for a 3 day break and went here for a meal second evening was fab so went back again third night Pizza beautiful and anti pasta sharing platters are fab also good value (by Myles Meagher) [a month ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Most amazing find on our short break in the area. Stunning food. Very authentic. Easy vibe. (by Lorraine Grace) [3 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - I recently visited RAW with a group of friends while in Killaloe for a stag. We were looking for some food and didn't feel like filling up on chipper food and so as we walked down Church Street we stumbled upon RAW!
What a little gem in Clare!

Staff:
The staff were great. They are very friendly, attentive and they were good humoured and had the craic with us.
Our server's name was Amelia and she was a delight!

Food:
They offer a variety of delicious freshly hand made pizzas and I chose the ""RAW's Luxury Pizza"". It was absolutely fantastic!
lt was full of flavour between the crispy base, Burrata cheese and the spicey Salami. The Burrata was in the centre on a bed of rocket!
I also ordered a side of the ""Hand Cut Oven Baked Spicy Wedges"" and I have to say they were amazing!

Drinks:
I ordered a cocktail with my meal and I have to say that they make lovely drinks here!
I also added the ""Dirty"" option to the cocktail which was an extra shot of rum to the best of my memory.

Decor:
The restaurant is located in what I believe was once an interiors shop. The dining area is decorated with all sorts of items giving the place a unique feel.

Wheelchair Accessibility:
The premises is on a hill but there is a flat level floor leading in from the street. The first floor is a decent size for maneuvering around the tables.
However, there is a step down to where the kitchen is and I am not sure if there are further tables down there.
I also think the toilets are down at this lower step, I am not sure if there is a wheel chair accessible toilet on the first floor that is lever with the street.

Overall:
I have to say that it was a really enjoyable experience dining at RAW for the first time!
The food is presented really well and tastes delicious. The staff were excellent and had a laugh with us.
I will definitely be back in the not too distant future! (by Thomas Thornton) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - EDIT: as of writing this, this locale no longer serves food. Bummer :(

Genuinely the best pizza I've ever eaten, I believe they have a genuine pizza firing oven, conventional ovens simply can't beat that. The serving staff are all very kind and efficient as well. Whenever I have an excuse to go there for a Pizza and coffee, I gladly do. Highly recommended, 11/10. (by Kacper) [Edited a month ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - This may sound dramatic, but this was the best meal I‚Äôve had in Ireland.

As you can see, the porkchop-to-rice ratio in the picture was generous (by Delfin, Khey) [6 months ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Good Philippino restaurant. Prices are pretty good, but portions are aligned with prices (sisig was very small and not much meat, more fat than anything). The Pork Sinigang was large and the broth was very tasty.

Food was a right portion and very cheap.  As no greens on a dish, you may want to order some vegetable dishes. Cash only. (by N W7) [a year ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - We have a Lechon Kiwali with Rice for 219 and a Lomi a 99 pesos.

The Lechon Kiwali is a bit dry, relatively oily, but the taste is okay and the portion given is quite substantial. It can be quite dry with just the Lechon and white rice, so I used some chili sauce with it.

The Lomi is similar to the Malaysian dish, Lor Mee Âç§Èù¢ (Braised Noodles), famous from Hulu Yam, with its distinct white thick soup containing egg whites. The difference is that Lomi here added some black peppers. The taste is good on its own. As it is not common to add black vinegar to this dish here, there are no suitable vinegar to add to the Lomi.

The staffs are friendly and the environment is relatively comfortable, despite not being air-conditioned. Note that the place is indoor with fans, it might be stuffy at times.

Overall, a good place for an affordable meal. (by Chee Hwa Tang) [a year ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Clare Restaurant is one of my go-to spots when I want affordable, delicious Filipino food.

Bangus was not boneless and served without the vegetables as seen on the picture. The chairs need to be clean. Nice ambiance, high ceiling and no music. A.C. is ok.

The food was pretty good, quite small portions compared to some pics online that we've seen so maybe a little inconsistent. The service however, from the young French guy (sorry we didn't catch your name) quite seriously made the experience for every single lunch diner today. He was bubbly and friendly, has a real presence about him, despite being busy, nothing was a trouble. He acknowledged the kids too. What a champion, I hope you pass on the positive feedback to him directly and know how valuable he was to your business today.  We would return and try another meal again.

The decor is nice and modern, and the food is without a doubt Michelin star worthy, more than worthy, as you can see from the pictures.
Well worth a visit here.

My only gripe was the cocktails, they were not traditionally made.. for example the whiskey sour was missing bitters and the old fashioned was fizzy. I have never had a fizzy old fashioned, and I would not have ordered it had I known it would be carbonated. The drinks menu should reflect what cocktails you have on offer, in addition to your own spin on drinks. However, still 5 stars, I had a lovely time here.

H√¥ NAI Vietnamese Kitchen,Clare,"228 Main N Rd, Clare SA 5453, Australia",Vietnamese restaurant,4.5,,,,,"Review 1: 4 stars - Tucked away from the hustle and bustle (because, let‚Äôs be honest, Clare‚Äôs ""bustle"" is about three tractors and a ute), there's a little treasure known only to the locals‚ÄîHo NAI Vietnamese Kitchen. It‚Äôs the kind of place where everyone walks in to a chorus of first-name greetings, except, of course, for you, the obvious outsider.

Naturally, we went straight for the Banh Mi, because why pretend to be adventurous? The staff, with a knowing grin, decided we weren‚Äôt built for the chilli. ""No chilli, too hot for you."" Wow. Read me like a book, didn‚Äôt they? Maybe it was the Melbourne glare in my eyes, or perhaps they just didn‚Äôt feel like calling an ambulance. Either way, we survived‚Äîalbeit mildly under-spiced.

But honestly, between the country-style hospitality (charmingly blunt) and the Vietnamese warmth (literal and figurative), the place is worth a stop‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre just passing through and need to be gently reminded that you're not quite as tough as you think you are.

We ordered tofu noodle bowl and spring roll noodle bowl but after ordering the woman at the cashier (can't call her waitress as she did not wait on us) told us they were out of rice noodles....(ie the type of thin rice noodle you buy at Foodland next door and cook up in 2 min).ummm?

So I changed mine to a tofu salad and my husband had springroll on fried rice.

This place was one of the poorer food experience in South Australia for the following reasons:

A) food was not authentic. No herbs not even coriander added to the salad
The fried rice was abysmal and not too different  from what you get from heating uncle Ben's. Dry, flavourless and dotted with frozen vegetables that were hard to chew
B) my meagre tofu salad was still $16 which was extremely overpriced even when it was supposed to have noodles in it.
C) everything served in takeaway containers even when eating in.

Really really ordinary  food and my only  recommendations for this place is not to waste your time or money there. Its not real Vietnamese food because it's so far from it. (by Amy K) [2 years ago] | Review 5: 2 stars - We love our Vietnamese and this wasn‚Äôt it üò¢. Both the stir-fry chicken noodles and the pork Com bowl were very overpriced for such a small bowl serving- we are still hungry. Noodles were cold. Both lacked flavour and meat/veg substance. (by Laura Conley) [2 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - To have somewhere In Clare and be able to say that the food is absolutely phenomenal, is genuinely exciting!! Thanks guys- not only are you super friendly, your b√°nh m√¨ was absolutely beautiful. Coming from Melbourne, my standards for Vietnamese food are high- you didn't disappoint. Legends.... (by K WH) [5 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Passing through Clare and I was a bit peckish for brunch. Stumbled across Ho Nai and did not regret it! Friendly service, fresh ingredients, tasty banh mi and the baguette was super light, crispy and with a cloud like centre - too yum (by David Maddison) [4 years ago] | Review 8: 3 stars - Roll was good.

The roll itself was pretty average the toppings were okay. It certainly wasn't bad, but there was room to improve.
When we were dining in, we noticed just about everyone had different noodle bowls - next time I'd give that a go over the roll (by Vanessa Phillips) [2 years ago]",https://www.google.com/maps/place/H%C3%B4+NAI+Vietnamese+Kitchen/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x6abbd1680f31fc7f:0x6b1ade3d26cf4847!8m2!3d-33.8344458!4d138.6126423!16s%2Fg%2F11hz907w1h!19sChIJf_wxD2jRu2oRR0jPJj3eGms

(by Angeline Burton) [3 days ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - An absolutely fabulous cafe in Kildysart. A real little gem. We went for a late lunch, my wife had the club sandwich and I had a burrito. Both were excellent, from a quality and portion perspective, we just couldn‚Äôt fault it in anyway.
It had the hum of being the village hotspot, with folks coming in for full dinners, to teenagers having coffee and cake. The complete cross section of the local community with the decor also giving the Clare vibe.
Seemly the breakfasts are to die for, looking forward to trying them the next time.
Long may this restaurant/cafe continue. (by Gerard Nagle) [11 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - We 3 had breakfast here - I've breakfasted in Claridge's and the London Savoy, but this place has them beat. Freshly cooked and plentiful, but most importantly the staff were a delight - very friendly but unobtrusive, and thoroughly genuine; the almost imperceptible care matters in this greedy world. I'll be back one day. (by Jack B) [2 years ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Lovely old style cafe. Perfectly clean, food was delicious and reasonably priced.

The food is far from good. Forget getting beans with your breakfast. Forget seeing any greens and/or salads with your omelette or avocado eggs. Everything comes with a few very sad looking potatoes. The presentation of food is basically non existence.

Really fresh.

We had the Angus double cheese burger, which suffered shrinkflation (the ketchup container is almost half the size of the burger). Same for soft drinks. For dessert we got the apple/berries crumble and the chocolate brownie, which were delicious. Apart from cost benefit, the atmosphere is good, family friendly. (by Bruna La√≠s Longo) [4 months ago] | Review 2: 3 stars - Okayish. The young man who served our table was very friendly and helpful, no complaints there. But the ma√Ætre d' didn't fill me with joy.

Would have given a two but that would do a disservice to the waiter at our table who was exemplary.

Unlikely to go back to eat there despite it being fairly close to home. There are better and cheaper options fairly nearby (by Edward W) [Edited 7 months ago] | Review 3: 1 star - Don‚Äôt bother driving or stopping here for food; signs on the doors say ‚ÄúFor Hotel Guests Only‚Äù!

Unfortunately when the salad arrived there were only microscopic pieces through the salad!! No bacon pieces either which is part of a Caesar salad!! We paid the bill as we felt the staff were young and there was no point in complaining!

Stayed here for a few days and ate multiple times in the pub.

The food was ok, very plain and unoriginal. I've never been inspired by vegetables, they were just bland, the chicken was tasteless. I would expect the price point of the food to mean the flavour would match the presentation. It's edible, but it needs work.

The burger was the best of them all (by Frank Dermody) [7 months ago] | Review 9: 3 stars - We were staying in the hotel and were tired from travel and touring so we ended up eating here 2 nights. First night we had the Wild Atlantic Way seafood sharing Board since we werent totally hungry after a late lunch. Everything on the platter was done well. My favorite was definitely the seafood risotto with the greens. The second night we had an order of the fish and chips, and the sausage plate (which is not on the on-line menu). The fish and chips were good, a good size meal, the pea mush was inedible. The sausage plate was a bit disappointing as the description said it same with several (3 or 4) kinds of sausage, yet when it arrived it had 3 links of all the same sausage.

We were greeted by friendly staff and shown to our table. It was a bit of a squeeze, despite the restaurant being nearly empty as it was at the beginning of lunch service. They put us at a small table at the back of the restaurant, two of which had been added when they shouldn‚Äôt have been as there wasn‚Äôt room for them. The menu was quite good and prices reasonable, so we were pleasantly surprised, but when the food came, the chowder was only okay, but the disappointment came with the chips/fries my husband had with his chicken Kiev. They were poor quality, but the oil obviously had to be changed. Overall, I probably set my expectations too high for this place.

Food came by 5:40pm but small portions for both adults and kids. Kids burgers were cooked from frozen to burnt and bundys were stale. Curry was very nice but tiny portion. Guinness was decent and staff later on in the evening were more attentive, but it would be a tough ask to return after having to get our own menus and have to go to the bar to ask to order our own food during a time where the hospitality sector is struggling.

It was saucier than an Indian curry, and not as intensely spiced, but the flavors were perfect. I wish I had the recipe, I would cook it for dinner tonight. The rest of the dishes were fantastic as well, but the lamb curry stole the show for me.

During dinner, the two brothers broke out musical instruments and begin performing, one on drums, the other on a unique Nepali fiddle-like stringed instrument. A cook and a musician, I have not seen that combo before, but it worked.

They told me they work with orphanages in Nepal helping orphans. They travel and volunteer, as well provide school supplies. They have some T-shirts printed up that you can purchase to help support their work.

I was blown away by their generosity, joy, and kindness, not to mention the food. If you have not been to the Everest Kitchen, put it on your list! I drove an hour round trip, and I don‚Äôt regret a moment of it. (by Mark Mahan) [4 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - We had an absolutely amazing experience at Everest Kitchen. Hira treated us as if we were guests in his home. The dishes we ordered were well spiced and full of flavor. He played beautiful music for us on his sarangi too! All in all just a wonderful experience that made us feel like we had traveled to Nepal! (by Kieran Burton) [2 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - We stumbled on this place during a weekend in Ennis, and I'm so glad we did!  The food was absolutely delicious, real home cooking with lots of flavour, big portion sizes, and very reasonably priced.  We brought our own bottle of wine and paid a small corking fee.  The owners are so warm and friendly, we had a wonderful evening chatting with them and with some of the other patrons.  We were treated to some beautiful sarangi playing as well, which was very special.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and good company!  Thank you for everything, Hiralal, we will see you again someday! (by Bay Baxter) [2 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - An excellent little restaurant in Ennis.  The hosts (Ramji and Hirala) were friendly, gracious, and attentive.  They even played some Nepalese traditional music live for us.  The food was fresh and delicious, the portions generous and well presented.  Definitely would go back again. (by Daniel McHugh) [4 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - We came to Ireland on a trip for the Willie Clancy festival, this place had the best food with the best music on the whole trip. The owners are great people and the food was amazing. We had a personal Sarangi performance and learned about some of the lovely history about Nepal. I would come back to Ireland just for this restaurant (plus the great Irish people). (by Josh B-W) [3 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Everest Kitchen in Ennis offers an unforgettable dining experience. The food is truly authentic and bursting with rich, flavoursome spices that transport you straight to the heart of Nepalese cuisine. Every dish is carefully prepared, showcasing a perfect blend of tradition and taste. The samosas and Nepalese chicken curry were delicious!

The hosts are incredibly welcoming and go above and beyond to ensure every guest feels at home. Their warmth and genuine hospitality made us feel really special.

Adding to the ambiance is the wonderful live music, which creates a relaxed yet vibrant atmosphere. It‚Äôs the perfect backdrop for enjoying the fantastic food and excellent company.

If you‚Äôre in Ennis, Everest Kitchen is not to be missed ‚Äì a true treasure for food lovers and those seeking a memorable night out! (by L F) [9 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Just had a very tasty meal at Everest in Ennis.
We needed a light meal after a long day of travel and the owner recommended that we share the Nepali Thali. For a starter we ordered the Vegetable Samosa. The samosa was served with a salad and had just the right amount of spice to get us ready for the main course. It included a large bowl of chicken curry, daal, spinach, steamed basmati rice, and a naan. We left happily satisfied with our dinner, leaving only our cleaned plates on the table. It was also very affordable.

The Curragower Bar and Kitchen,Clare,"Clancy's Strand, Deanery Land, Limerick, Ireland",Gastropub,4.5,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 1 star - We booked a team dinner here based on strong recommendations and had colleagues visiting from the U.S., so expectations were high.

Unfortunately, the experience didn‚Äôt quite live up to the hype. The room we were seated in was extremely warm‚Äîso much so that we ended up using our dessert menus as fans just to stay comfortable. At this price point (we spent nearly ‚Ç¨400), I would have expected a better dining environment.

On the food side, it was a bit of a mixed bag. Most dishes were good‚Äîthe fish, in particular, was excellent and I‚Äôd recommend it. However, the burger was disappointing. When I went to take a bite, something (possibly the bacon) didn‚Äôt sit right. Thankfully, our server was very professional and helpful‚Äîshe provided great service and kindly removed the burger from the bill without hesitation.

Overall, the experience was just okay. Given the price, I‚Äôd be hesitant to return, but credit where it‚Äôs due: the service was warm and attentive, and the fish was a standout.

****update**** 27th Of August

We went back again and the experience was different.

Staff were nice and the food was good. (by Geoff Hassett) [Edited a month ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - It's a fabulous place to sure outside and enjoy and great view. Make sure you make reservations as they do book up very quickly. We had great seats outdoors and ordered wine and beer. We ordered their fish and chips, seabreem and mackerel. We got a side order of salad as well. The food was very good. The chips with the fried fish were especially good! We ended with their sticky toffee pudding which was good but I think the pecans took away from the traditional flavor but I did enjoy the crunch. Overall it was a very good experience. (by Monica Puri Bangia) [a month ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - The plus side of Curragower: it has a wonderful view of the Shannon and King John's Castle across the river, especially if you choose outside seating. The place was so buy when we ate there that we didn't have that option.

The down side: it's a bit touristy and the quality of its food is uneven. My seafood chowder was okay, but just yesterday in Limerick, I had a bowl of seafood chowder that was superior to what Curragower offers. Its bowl is generous with seafood, but the sauce is thick as if flour has been added to it.

My dining companion was disappointed that his seafood pie was far more potato than seafood. The food is well-plated and attractive, however. Service is quick and efficient, and the surroundings are very pleasant. So take your pick, plus or minus: nice surroundings, good service, great view, but food that can vary in quality. (by William Lindsey) [2 weeks ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Must go! We had the chicken waffles, seafood chowder, and seafood pie. All were chock-full of flavor. The seafood chowder came with brown bread and was stuffed with various fish. The seafood pie was topped with delicious savory mashed potatoes and was piping hot. Chicken and waffles with salsa had just a little heat and was sweet, perfect! Servers were friendly and worked quickly. The covered patio with glass windows is beautiful on a clear or rainy day and offers gorgeous views of the water. They carry lots of zero-zero options. Can't wait to go again! (by Adelina Mart) [2 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Grabbed a quick meal here. The food was tasty and the staff was very friendly. Highly recommend the seating on the upper level, which was a glass enclosure, with lots of plants, and great views of the castle and river. (by Jason Yeager) [2 weeks ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - Lovely atmosphere. Reservations required and we got the glass house. Hostess wasn‚Äôt there when we arrived but seated us once she got there. Food was alright. Fish was bug portion but soggy in middle (frozen / not cooked long enough?) ‚Äî pity as the parts not soggy were lovely. Prawns were a little rubbery yet shell not crispy (grill not hot enough?) & the 3 sauces lacked flavour. Chips were delicious (both thin & double cooked). (by Saba L.) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Nice cozy bar with terrace view to river Shannon. Food is very good, stuff is very helpful and nice. If you wish to dine on the terrace you will been to book a table, but there is plenty space inside for walk ins guests. (by Galina Nikolayenko) [3 weeks ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - We stumbled upon this place after walking from King John‚Äôs castle. We wanted seafood and they delivered. We ordered the mussels, calamari, seabream and a side of Caesar. The seabream was nicely seasoned with a crispy edge and it came with risotto, a giant prawn and caviar. My son ate most of the mussels and calamari so I think that means it was great. We finished with Eton Mess ‚Äî a meringue dessert. (by Nichelle S) [2 months ago] | Review 9: 4 stars - Had an amazing meal at The Curragower Bar and Kitchen ‚Äî this place seriously hits the spot. It's right by the river with views of King John's Castle (major bonus), and the vibe is just chill and welcoming.

The food? Unreal.
Tried a few vegetarian options and was genuinely impressed. The Eden Burger is packed with flavour, the risotto is creamy and comforting, and the summer salad is super fresh and zingy ‚Äî perfect on a warm day. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the sticky toffee pudding... rich, gooey, and absolutely lip-smacking. You need to save room for it.

Parking can be a little hit or miss since it‚Äôs close to the city centre ‚Äî give yourself a few extra minutes to find a spot, especially during busy times.

All in all, great food, lovely staff, and one of the nicest spots in Limerick to kick back with a pint or a proper meal. Highly recommend! (by Karthik Radhakrishna) [3 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Busy spot, especially on a Friday night, but we had a reservation and I‚Äôm glad I got to go!!

They‚Äôre known for their chicken wings, which really were delicious, and I also tried their fish taco which was gigantic.

Generous portion size, great interior decor and atmosphere with really friendly service!

I recommend if you‚Äôre ever in Limerick. (by Jon W) [5 months ago]",https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Curragower+Bar+and+Kitchen/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x485b5d6ee39c413b:0x7ae222aa959ec689!8m2!3d52.6685635!4d-8.6278127!16s%2Fg%2F11g2xg2bml!19sChIJO0Gc425dW0gRicaelaoi4no

Mughal Knight Restaurant,Clare,"28-29 High St, Clare, Sudbury CO10 8NY, United Kingdom",Indian restaurant,4.5,,,,,"Review 1: 1 star - UPDATE: Updating the rating to 1 star from 3 stars because the restaurant is lying. I made the order and my partner did not speak even a single word about the things we ordered. Upon asking why it was added the server did specifically mention that we add chutney tray automatically if a papadom is ordered. We both had the same experience and my partner had her own views. It is sad that we are being accused of lying instead of restaurant taking the constructive feedback and fixing things in it's establishment. We are all for supporting small businesses but if you lie to your customers on a public platform then it doesn't make you look nice.
As far as reservations are concerned, we were not asked if we had a reservation. If the restaurant did not have space then you could've just said to us and we would've walked.
And people reading the reviews can see our profile to check how many reviews we have written and if they really are fake. :)
------------------------------
We were 2 and we ordered 2 papadoms, chicken tikka, chicken shashlik bhuna, tarka daal, garlic naan, cheese naan and a couple of soft drinks. Total bill: ¬£42.95

The good:
Chicken pieces were tender, naan was really soft and the tarka daal was really nice with garlic flavour. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice and cosy with bollywood songs playing in the background. The restaurant is BYOB so that is good as well.

The bad:
We did not order chutney tray which was added to our order by the restaurant staff and served to us, initially we thought the chutneys were complimentary but they were not. Upon asking why it was added, the answer we got was the tray always comes if you order papadoms. Then why is it on the menu if it is ""automatically"" served with each papadom? Doesn't make sense at all. It should be the other way around if it has to be this way. This should be clearly written on the menu or the staff should tell the customer when taking the order instead of just adding it in the bill. This is not about the ¬£2.95 being added to your bill, it is about the clarity for the customer.

The coke and sprite we ordered were not served out of cans they were just filled in a glass from either the bar or the kitchen, the menu showed cans but there was no fizz in drinks and were either watered down or served from a bigger bottle which was flat.

The chicken tikka was not authentic, it did not look like it was charred in the clay oven like it should be. (by Devansh Gilani) [Edited 4 months ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Great food in here the other night. The ‚Äúbring your own alcohol‚Äù is great as it does really save on the bill. But the staff can be a little slow sometimes, we had to ask for a beer glass 3 times and chase them for wine cooler etc. despite it not being very busy.

The food is always expcetional, fresh tasting and a great selection to chose from. One of the best Indians around the area.

Booking can be done in advance can also be very busy in the evenings, there is a good atmosphere in the restaurant with very nice lighting, the chairs are very comfortable and the place is very clean to. Parking is available on street free of charge in designated spaces, try visiting Clare Village Suffolk during the day very historic with its castle mound, parks, antique shops, boutique shops, three village pubs, and a railway platform with a caf√©.

Seven of us went to Morrissey's for dinner. One of the best nights of my life.

The staff are the unsung heroes of the restaurant, always smiling and quick to ask if you want another drink, or just checking that your food is ok.

The food was amazing. When you're traveling around Ireland, you do sometimes lower expectations as you
never know what you're going to get....but Morrissey's exceeded our expectations.

My dad rates it number 1 on his Seafood chowder chart and that is very high praise indeed!! Would highly recommend üëå (by Hannah O'Brien) [2 years ago] | Review 3: 1 star - Avoid if You Have Children ‚Äì Terrible Experience

We had a truly disappointing experience at Morrissey‚Äôs Restaurant and would strongly advise families‚Äîespecially those with young children‚Äîto steer clear. From the moment we walked in, it was clear we were unwelcome. Our children were in good spirits‚Äîgiddy, yes‚Äîbut by no means disruptive or loud. Still, the
Male manager looked visibly displeased at our presence and pointedly ignored us throughout the meal.

While he made rounds to check in on every other table, he never once acknowledged us or asked if we needed anything. When my 4 year-old daughter accidentally spilled her drink (nothing broke), we quickly cleaned it up ourselves, yet the staff response was cold and dismissive. One staff member eventually came over to take the remaining napkins but barely said a word and couldn‚Äôt look at us when we apologised.

We ordered soups, chowder, and fries, but only one portion of skinny fries arrived initially. When we pointed this out, they didn‚Äôt bother to bring the remaining fries until we had already finished the soup. No apology, no urgency‚Äîjust more indifference.

We had to ask for bread with our soups/chowder yet every other table seemed to be greeted with bread on arrival.

Overall, we felt mistreated and unwelcome. It‚Äôs clear this restaurant does not cater to or care for families with children, and that‚Äôs a shame. We won‚Äôt be returning.

Just to note there was one darker haired girl possibly not Irish, who made an effort to be pleasant to us, thank you. (by C Crowe) [3 months ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - Gentleman waiting on us was very nice and efficient.

(by Nalinee Yeung) [10 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - My husband and I were in Clare for two nights and ate here both evenings. On the first evening we had no reservation but the man kindly fit us in. I had the steak and my husband had the chowder and both were 10/10. I am gluten free so after taking my order the waiter came back out to tell me I couldn't have the onion rings but that they could give me saut√©ed mushrooms instead and so I got a huge portion of these. Instead of being made to feel like an inconvenience the staff could not have been more accommodating or helpful. On the second night my husband got fish and chips and I got the seabass. Again my meal had to be altered because of food allergies and this was no problem for the staff. Each staff member we met was so helpful and kind. My husband had Guinness both nights with his meal and said it was lovely. Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Doonbeg or the surrounding area. We would recommend booking ahead as it is very popular. Thanks you Morrissey's we will be back! (by Edwina Cooney) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - We are staying nearby at the Trump Doonbeg resort. We wanted to see the cute town of Doonbeg.

The starters were incredible - the crab legs, wings, crab tostada. The various cocktails we ordered were a great bonus. And the four different mains we tried were all fantastic. The soup to the burger to the catch of the day and the fish and chips. They were all fantastic. (by Sarah Beth Felix) [2 years ago] | Review 8: 1 star - Terrible experience manager was rude and made no effort to offer any kind of customer service.

We had two small children and it was clear they were not welcome when my four-year-old spilled a drink this was met with distain and horror. The Manager on duty at the time was particularly rude and could not even bring himself to look at our table

Avoid at all costs (by Ashley Crowe) [3 months ago] | Review 9: 1 star - Legal robbery!! üò°
We came back to Morrisseys as we had been here before for a birthday celebration and had a delightful time.
This was NOT that time.
First impressions count, and the bar and atmosphere did not disappoint. However the lack of a themed attire for the staff was a bit disconcerting. Although I suppose jeans and runners are a theme!
Drinks were brought to us swiftly, by an experienced waiter, who placed them on the table by gripping the rim with his fingers!!! Why didn't he just take a sip! ü§¢
Then cleaned an adjacent table with MR SHEEN!!
When the starters came out, we were left hunting for the crab claws. Tiny!! These obviously didn't pass any sizing gauge. As for flavour, what flavour?! Only thing you could taste was the oil they were served in.
As for my tostada's, OMG. I thought the inclusion of guacamole and sriracha mayo would be interesting, however once again the only thing you could taste was the sauces.
Our mains arrived approximately 10 minutes apart, chunky chips raw, and my steak was cooked to perfection. However it was very lonely on such a large plate, a side plate would have done.
When finally my wifes linguine arrived I could literally see her heart breaking. She lovvvves prawns, and would probably have ordered a side order of them had she known how few she was getting. Bland pasta and tasteless prawns. Needless to say that dish went back.
Dessert was not much better, my sticky toffee pudding was no longer caramelized but burnt and my wife's brownie was as dry as a desert!
To say we were disappointed is putting it mildly, this was a complete disaster from start to finish. Thankfully I didn't have to pay for the returned main, burnt dessert or our drinks. But when I mentioned to the waiter the manner in which he delivered our drinks, the lack of apologies for the delayed, raw, and burnt food, his reaction was as if he was saying ""so??""
Service was amateur at best, food dire and prices astronomical.
Just as a side note, we are also in the hospitality industry, but to a much lesser level. When we are asked for places to eat in the evening, we often recommend local restaurants close to where the customer is staying, and often Morrisseys is our go to place. Not any more.
Without the customer you have no business. If Morrisseys fail to remember this they will not be there for much longer. (by Kevyn Murphy) [2 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Fantastic meal, has to be one of the best seafood places around and has a fantastic view of the waterfront. If you‚Äôre there in a warmer month get a place on the covered patio to really take in the scenery over the River Doonbeg. Incredibly friendly staff and service and if you‚Äôre staying at the nearby Trump property the hotel will drop you down and bring you back allowing everyone to have a pint. The service was tremendous and they fit us in on an a very busy night.

The bbq wings were very tasty and anyone who had prawns for starters and mains said it was excellent. The pulled pork was also very tasty. For mains the burgers were very good one said the burgers were bit thick and bit round but onion rings were really good. Goats cheese for mains was very tasty   2 balls of goats cheese were rolled in walnuts and this really added to the dish. There was too much goats cheese and needed some more onion. Side of potato gratin was a little undercooked for my liking and quite stiff but that's personal choice! Staff were brilliant and on hand without being in your face.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting, making it a great spot for both casual dinners and special occasions.

The staff are incredibly professional and helpful. Attentive without being intrusive. For dinner, the fish special was fresh and flavourful, but the real standout was the fish and chips: perfectly crisp light batter and thick-cut chips that hit the mark.

Desserts felt like an elevated nod to homely classics, with creative modern twists that ended the meal on a high note. Add to that a solid drinks selection and a lovely outdoor garden space ideal for relaxed after-dinner drinks, and you‚Äôve got a place well worth returning to.

Highly recommended. (by Ain View Studio Dubai) [a month ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - After our adventure to the foreboding Bunratty castle we called in at JP Clarkes Irish pub. It‚Äôs a large sprawling venue with indoor and outdoor space. Clearly it‚Äôs grown over the years due to its popularity and reputation.

Our host had made a reservation and we were quickly shown to our spacious booth, the interior is a mix of country pub and American dining, with plenty of booths, tables and small intimate spots if you‚Äôre looking for a little romantic spot..

The waiter was chatty and charming, cajoling us to order drinks and food quickly as it‚Äôs apparent this is a busy place, there were also some specials inc salmon with a chorizo crust but we all found dishes from the main menu.

Fish and chips, BBQ pulled pork tostadas, cheesy potatoes, salad and the chicken supreme was ordered. Being honest the fish possibly could have done with a little longer in the fryer and the mushy peas would have been heaps better home made, although top marks for serving Heinz ketchup ! The side salad was a little tired, however, my chums all remarked how yummy thier food was and their empty plates proved it.

It was my partners birthday, we were delighted (he was scarlet with embarrassment) as the team sung happy birthday whilst presenting a complimentary birthday plate complete with his name and birthday candle. Thank you very very much.

As we were leaving gentle live music was beginning in the bar which created a very nice ambiance- this place evidently runs like clockwork and they definitely know what they‚Äôre doing.

You could celebrate many occasions here and I‚Äôm sure JP Clarkes have many regulars to prove it.

Timeout Tavern,Clare,"601 N McEwan St, Clare, MI 48617, United States",Bar & grill,4.4,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Went for lunch with five other friends while they were having clear music fest with live musics in many of the bars/restaurants.  It was pretty busy, but the whole town was busy because of the fast. Service was excellent in fact better than excellent. Lisa was astounding. She was personable and was very helpful with any questions you may have had.  The prices were competitive, but the food was excellent. I got the dill pickle fries, which are not dill pickle spears. They are much thinner than that and actually the breading stayed very crispy (served with ranch).  Two of the other people had the berry salad which they both said was delicious. I ordered a chef salad, which was really good but needed to be served in a bowl. I think it would‚Äôve been a lot easier to eat from a bowl since you couldn‚Äôt really toss it up on a plate once you put the salad dressing on and there was more lettuce than was needed. One guest had the chili and Caesar salad and enjoyed. My husband had two orders of the Mexican street corn dip and liked it. After living in Mount Pleasant for years, and the food quality going way down with prices going way up in that city this was so refreshing!  I may have to choose to drive to Clare from now on. üòÅ (by Connie Bills) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - The burger was cooked perfectly.  That can't be understated.  I asked for medium and it was just right and the beef flavor is amazing.  The chicken and waffles was awesome too.  The flavors were great, the waffle homemade. (by Phillip Sprague) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - $47 for what you see in the pictures plus two pops. This includes tips. Value seems low for the price.

8‚Äù pizzas weren‚Äôt good, soggy bread, taste was decent but small and not as good as I would expect for the premium price as compared to Beaverton Tavern pizza or Riverwalk Places new appetizer flatbread that is amazing for $16 and 2x the size.

Pasta tasted bland and was very small for the price $16 when I‚Äôve had Honey Stung Mac n Cheese at Riverwalk Place that was 2x bigger for $20. And just tasted like something worth going out to eat.

Went there trying to find and support local businesses on a date and heard it was good place but maybe we hit them on a bad Saturday at 6pm. It was all decent but they need to raise the bar a little bit because I think this place could be awesome. Great location, great interior and exterior seating and if they step up the food it would be awesome. (by Tyler Plude) [a month ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Great small town restaurant.

I had the famous tavern burger and let me tell you it knocked my socks off, it should really be famous in my opinion, so juicy. I been going to Applebee's since I was a youngin and I always got their bacon burger but this tavern burger is FAR better and that's coming from a former fat boy who knows his burgers. Loved the staff, loved the atmosphere, let's just say you got yurself a new regular! (by quaty broichtis) [a month ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - So happy the owners were here tonight!

We stopped in for lunch a dessert and we loved it!  The servers were very prompt and professional and the food was great!  Definitely try dessert too!

Russells Seafood Bar,Clare,"Fiddle + Bow Hotel, Teergonean, Doolin, Co. Clare, V95 XR0K, Ireland",Seafood restaurant,4.8,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Amazing seafood restaurant in Doolin! It‚Äôs extremely popular, so reservations are highly recommended ‚Äì though we were lucky to get a table after waiting at the bar for 15 minutes, thanks to the kind manager‚Äôs advice. The service was warm and welcoming, and the food was outstanding.

We started with whipped goat cheese with dates, almonds, and hot honey ‚Äì an incredible mix of flavors. For mains, we had the fish of the day (seabass) and lamb. Both were perfectly cooked: the fish was unbelievably fresh, and the lamb tender and flavorful. Even though we were nearly full, we couldn‚Äôt resist dessert ‚Äì sticky toffee pudding and Eton mess ‚Äì and both were absolutely delicious.

And the cherry on top ‚Äì they have live music every day, which makes the atmosphere even more special. Truly one of the best meals we‚Äôve had in Ireland! (by Anastasiia Bozhyk) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - It‚Äôs a lovely place. Food is amazing, especially that fish and chips, best one in Ireland!
The portion of starters is quite huge. I ordered mussels and it came with a big bowl. I couldn‚Äôt finish my main at the timeü§£ Bring some home and after reheating, it is still delicious!!!

There is a group playing music as well, very chill!

We were really lucky to beat the dinner crowd and seated right way without a reservation. Tuesday night and they were pack.

They have irish traditional live music every night too (by niken ariani) [2 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - One of the best meals we have had in Ireland. Gorgeous rustic decor, relaxed vibe, good service and great food.
We enjoyed the whole fish of the day and fish and chips. Loved the porn star martinis and the fish soup was amazing. (by Claire Hornsby) [3 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - We had a few drinks as well as the Wagu beef, mussels appetizer, sides of potato salad and the colcannon mashed potatoes.  Wrapping the evening with Black Forest cheesecake.  Today was my husbands birthday and the brought dessert with a candle and sang happy birthday‚Ä¶ I merely mentioned in convo with the waitress it was his birthday did not ask for anything special.  Drinks and food were great,  service outstanding.  All in all an excellent meal and service. (by lisa mccormick) [4 weeks ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Atmosphere:
Very clean, upscale, and earthy vibe. Dark gray walls contrasted well natural wood accents, furniture, and greenery.

Staff:
Very friendly and attentive. Throughout our entire experience multiple people checked in on us.

Wagyu Beef Shin:
Also known as Beef Shank for those of us from the US. This was slow roasted and hands down, the best Beef Shin/Shank I have ever had. The mashed potatoes were very smooth and had lots of garlic flavor. It came with a side of vegetables. The parsnip was my favorite. It was well cooked and seasoned and had a good amount of sweetness.

Sea Bream (Special of the Day):
The fish was a whole fish. You were able to choose two sides, we chose the salad and vegetables. The fish was extremely good, very well cooked, and very flavorful. The side salad had a great homemade dressing.

Lemon Meringue Pie:
The lemon was a perfect balance between sweet and tart. The meringue was fluffy with a perfect char on top. The crust was fresh and not soggy.

Overall, the entire experience was truly exceptional. From the staff, atmosphere, and world class cuisine, this was easily one of our favorite restaurants we have ever experienced. (by Jon Jong) [5 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - What a meal. Had the oysters, mussels, and fish & chips. All were absolutely delicious. The old fashioned was excellent too. Service was 10/10.

Our waitstaff both evenings were great and very personable, even striking up nice conversations when prompted. The atmosphere is cozy chic, not stuffy at all. A singer performed trad tunes a cappella the second night, which was great. The food is very fresh and delicious.  I started with the oysters, husband the Brie.  Very tasty.  I ordered different specials both nights and husband enjoyed the fish and chips one night and lamb the second night.  Rounded out one evening with the sticky toffee pudding and the other with a mango and lime posset. Everything tasted as great as it looks. Stop in if you‚Äôre in Doolin- you won‚Äôt be disappointed!

The meals were so delicious that we asked for extra bread to mop up the sauce afterwards. The portions are generous that you will be more than satisfied and are very reasonably priced. Truly impressed by this place, the staff were welcoming and friendly. Would recommend to anyone. (by Ross Lewis) [3 years ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - The restaurant is well located in the centre of town and a popular spot with locals and tourists alike. The menu offers a good selection of dishes with about 6 pasta dishes, 5 fish dishes, non Italian dishes (burgers) and a very wide selection of pizzas.

Our waiter was very friendly and service was excellent. We all opted for pasta dishes and all were excellent. We found all the dishes pretty expensive for pasta with most of them costing around ‚Ç¨18.

I had the spaghetti pollo and it was a little heavy on cream and light on the pollo. It would also have been nice to have some bread before or with our meal.

Overall it was an enjoyable experience and we will probably return for pizza before we leave Lahinch. (by Niall Larkin) [3 years ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - We came on a weeknight, no wait.

If there was more shaved parmesan that would have been even better.  My partner ordered a margherita pizza and again i was surprised - the dough was light and almost fluffy... the crust was crispy but not hard and there was ample cheese on it.  Fair prices as well! Would def recommend! (by Gloria Lau) [6 years ago] | Review 7: 1 star - Total ripoff takeaway.
Ordered the wonderful sounding vegetarian pizza,,16 euro..hello.
Asked for extra time to go have a pint.
I'm thinking, they taking advantage of customer having too much drink on board. Which I didn't.
I expected a reasonable good Vegetarian pizza, basically got a Margarita, ie, belly full of cheese

Breakfast was excellent and the staff were always very attentive and friendly.
The only issue we experienced was a strong petrol/kerosene smell in the room. It was quite intense the first night, much less noticeable the next day, but unfortunately returned again on the second night. In addition, there was a generator-type humming noise that turned on and off, which was more noticeable during the night.
Overall, we really enjoyed the hotel and, once these issues are addressed, it would make for a perfect stay.

Both dishes were tasty but the Chicken one had nothing to do with Thai. It was more of an Indian Curry served with Naan (or an attempt to), chutney and rice. The dish was oddly also accompanied with french fries. The Cheesecake of the day was, as expected, Baileys but the taste was really subtle. Overall a good lunch.

Especially at a ‚Ç¨17 price point. I would challenge whether the chef has actually tried a real bowl of ramen or just read a list of ingredients and filled in the gaps themselves.
The chicken was just dry chunks of chopped up breast meat (no fat or skin), the egg was hard boiled and not marinated and then just loads of chunky chopped mushrooms.

The first person to greet us was Aidan, he treated us like queens. He is indeed the King of Dromoland Castle. After his warm welcome,  he guided us to our lovely afternoon  tea  in the Earl of Thomand restaurant. All staff were so friendly and professional.  The waitresses were so good and looking after us in a very nice way. The food was incredible and we got a complimentary starter from the chef and it was yummy.  The finger sandwiches were carefully made with nice selection of flavours.  The cakes and pastries were so decorated and full of fresh flavours and at the end we got hot scones which was a nice ending. I recommend the single tower plates as they have more selections than the twin towers.
We got a table with a window view of the castle with lake which was fascinating.  We also got the castle blend tea and it was the right cup of tea. We went  for a walk afterwards, and one gentleman of the staff helped us to take a family photo and the whole place was like a story in a fairytale book. The place is super clean,  spotless.

Amazing food with top notch staff and extensive wine list.  ‚ÄúBest of Ireland‚Äù without a doubt!  We will be back. (by Ken Faulkner) [a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Kudos for catering well to vegetarians and vegans (3.5 / 5 Green Stars)
Having just come from Ashford Castle (long story!) the atmosphere at Dromoland was more relaxing and less formal. The service, however, was just as good, if not better, because the staff were more themselves. We ate at the Earl of Thomond twice for breakfast and once for dinner and were very happy with all the meals and service.

For dinner, we went crazy and had the full tasting menu ‚Äì one vegetarian (‚Ç¨95) and one ‚Äúregular‚Äù (‚Ç¨105). Our dinner seating was towards the end of the evening so our server may have been horrified that we ordered this (we were there until almost 11 pm!) but he was cheerful throughout the service. We actually joked half-way though the dinner because when ordering I‚Äôd said ‚Äúthis is simple ‚Äì one regular and one vegetarian tasting menu.‚Äù With nine courses, the dinner is anything but simple ‚Äì I had only meant that ordering it was simple!

Overall, the omnivore was probably more impressed with her food than I was with my vegetarian offerings. For breakfasts, my shakshuka was nicely done while the ‚Äúvegetarian breakfast‚Äù was good in parts (amazing spinach) but also had a few weak points (potato cake). For dinner, the vegetarian tasting menu also had a weak point or two ‚Äì the risotto was a little too al dente for me, for example. But that‚Äôs not bad for a nine-course meal.

Some of the smaller items were the most impressive:

The Cashel Blue Cheese Panna Cotta with walnut and pickled blackberries: this was my first time having panna cotta as it‚Äôs not normally vegetarian. Great start to the dinner.
Cratloe Hills Sheep‚Äôs Cheese Ravioli in rooster potato broth: The potato broth was the star of this dish.
Blood Orange & Green Peppercorn Sorbet in Campari jus: we both had this as it‚Äôs on the omnivore tasting menu too. Amazing!
For breakfast there were many highlights but the scones and pain aux raisins were my favorites. Don‚Äôt forget to ask for clotted cream for the scones! Thank you to all the staff at Dromoland! Keep up the vegetarian and vegan food!

I‚Äôm giving the Earl of Thomond 3.5 out of 5 Green Stars for social and environmental impact, for these reasons:

‚Ä¢ The Earl of Thomond has gone all out to cater to vegetarians, with a full vegetarian tasting menu and a vegetarian √† la carte menu that includes three vegan items. There‚Äôs also a nice vegetarian breakfast menu.
‚Ä¢ Their main √† la carte menu is pretty much all meat- or fish-based, except for a goat cheese starter. It kind of makes sense to separate vegetarian from non-vegetarian onto two menus but it‚Äôs a bit sad because it implies that the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù diet is almost completely animal-based. Duplicating some of the vegetarian menu items on the main menu could encourage some ‚Äúnormal‚Äù people to mix in some veggies, now that the planet is on the brink of a climate disaster!
‚Ä¢ Sources of most meat, fish and cheeses are named. Some of the meat is wild-caught (rabbit, pheasant, venison).
‚Ä¢ Foie gras is on the menu ‚Äì I‚Äôve read up on more-ethical foie gras, but it‚Äôs still not great.
‚Ä¢ Most of their ingredients are sourced in Ireland and almost everything is made in-house. (by James K) [2 years ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Very nice dinner in a well appointed castle.

(by Brian Leung) [a year ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Our family of three spent our last Ireland vacation day at Dromoland Castle and had dinner in the Earl Of Thomond restaurant. What a fantastic dining experience; we were treated like royalty. The food and service were impeccable. The harp music was a lovely accompaniment to dinner. Shout out to Eric whose drink recommendations complemented our meal choices perfectly. (by A Maroney) [11 months ago] | Review 9: 3 stars - To start, I must say that Ricardo the Sommelier was the savior of the evening. I appreciate how much he ran around trying to cover for many inadequacies of the evening.
On entry, the hostess was lovely but also thought we were other people entirely (which was honestly more amusing than anything else).
For the meal we were quickly greeted by Ricardo for drink discussion and he was extremely knowledgeable and thorough and our order was taken by what appeared to be the manager of the restaurant. We ordered the tasting menu with sommelier accompaniment. Our first and second course were quickly brought to us and often the staff were trying to take plates away quickly and presenting them without a break. On the second course we delayed starting to eat it by at least 5-10 minutes wondering where the paired wine was, and eventually continued on as multiple staff looked at our table and no one came out to bring anything. Shortly after we noticed another table getting the same course and quickly receiving the appropriate pairing. At that time, there was still no one acknowledging our table and the second sommelier brought out an entirely unrelated wine (which was not served at any point during the pairing) and quickly left again bringing us nothing. We did note that Ricardo had a side discussion with our servers and took over bringing us appropriate wines and apologizing for the mishap. Our servers continued to bring things too quickly and one kept attempting to take away our plates before we were close to finished with the drink or the course. At the end, our server didn't know to ask us for our tea or coffee preference and tried to leave us without explaining the course or giving any information. Thankfully we had noted the drink pairing on review of the menu initially and called her back to request the appropriate items.

In general, it appeared that we were present for the large group of new summer hires. Most of our servers did not appear to understand appropriate serving etiquette. While we initially were trying to be understanding and patient (having noted at prior establishments that summer hiring was in full swing) it did become increasingly frustrating. Had the meal not cost what it did, our expectation standard would not have been remotely the same. As the evening progressed the hostess and manager stepped in to take over helping tables requiring them to sacrifice their own post.

Overall, I have never felt quite so rushed and ignored at the same time while eating a meal. Especially when paying more than $250 a person. While the experience was pleasant, I would recommend another location if your desire is for an optimal fine dining experience. If your desire is to eat at the Dromoland castle specifically, I would recommend ordering something other than the tasting menu so the cost to service ratio is more appropriate.

(by Kevin Hannigan) [Edited a week ago] | Review 2: 1 star - I ordered Singapore noodles with Tofu as a takeaway. The menu says it's vegan however there were eggs in it.
Disappointed with this. Would never recommend as I had requested while placing the order to avoid it.

Edit - I had requested a Vegan option mentioning while adding Tofu with it and specifically requested to avoid any contamination and was assured the same.

It was like a soup but full of soy sauce. Also, chicken was absolutely dehydrated and the rice!!!! Microwave rice with terrible taste. Absolutely, don't go here. Also had to wait for takeout for 25 min for this food really ridiculous. (by H.

The service was good, someone took my order quickly and the food was delivered to my table in about 3 or 4 minutes. I also like that you pay when you order.
The food itself was not nice at all. The portion size was big but the dish tasted kind of sweet and was unbelievably oily. The tofu was very nice. (by Ciara S) [3 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Lovely gluten free vegan options.

Love their sweet n sour, not too heavy ‚Ä¶ (by H (H)) [3 years ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - We're fancy trying Asian street food and this place was suggested. Ordered Pad Thai and Veg Curry. Pad Thai was absolutely a delight and definitely recommend this to anyone looking for veg options. They added Tofu instead of chicken which was brilliant. Veg curry was a bit blunt and not what we expected it to taste based on our previous experience with same curry in Thailand. Rice needs a special attention as it wasnt cooked properly. Not the best ambience, but perhaps is sufficient as the dine in space is really tight. 10/10 to the staff! (by uday kalyani) [2 years ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - There is a lot that goes into the dining experience at Ramen. The staff here is friendly and warm, and are extremely pleasant to talk to. The food here is amazing, the best Asian food I've had in Ireland so far. And the quantity is great too, which is quite rare for most restaurants. Other than that, we get complimentary fortune cookies and ice creams with our meal. Absolutely love this place! (by Aditeya) [5 years ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - The food is amazing, fair price. Lovely atmosphere, music background very relaxing. The staffs are friendly and polite.
As a plus the you can get juice free and ice cream. So, nothing to complain and for sure I would recommend this place.

The pie was well made - very hot but letting it crack open and mixing the ingredients helped bring it to an eating temperature. The meat was slow cooked and tender and flavored well.

The cocktails were impressive, the fries were good, we liked the burgers too. The fish and chips look well portioned.

Solid pub experience. (by Sameet Sapra) [4 months ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Beautiful meal. It's been a while since I've been in there. I got thr cauliflower steak..it was divine and presented so well. The only negative is I think it should come with mash/chips. It wouldn't fill me on its own so I ordered chips separately. The dessert was unreal..i got a peanut butter jelly amd honeycomb parfait type. Would recommend. (by Stephanie o connor) [4 months ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - We stumbled upon this place while looking for somewhere to eat one evening. The vegetable pakoras we had to start were nice. The vegan burger (which was ordered without hummus) was very dry and the bun had an odd texture. This might have been because it was a vegan brioche bun. The cauliflower steak was delicious and is definitely the best veggie/vegan option to go for.

The service was impeccable and the staff were very accommodating, despite our lack of a reservation. Our meal (with two pints) came to ‚Ç¨65.

We rang ahead to ask about vegan options and they said they would be able to make something vegan if we mentioned it in the notes of our online booking üå±

The service was amazing, checking in just the right amount. They made me a vegan starter of foccaccia with pickled and roast veg on top - delicious! Vegan main they offered a few pasta dishes or risotto, I went for mint pesto pasta with crispy fried courgette on top. They also have vegan lemon sorbet for dessert. ü§© (by Isabel Bourke) [a year ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - Great spot for authentic Italian cuisine. Service is exceptional.

While the service started off a bit slow, eventually things seemed to get into a better pace. The two servers working were very professional and friendly.

The food itself was excellent. We had 4 courses plus a dessert. We also had focaccia  made in-house with some great olive oil. All very fresh, high quality ingredients, made in-house, authentic Italian dishes that weren‚Äôt just pasta and pizza. The lamb ragu was a particular standout for both of us! Much of the food was sourced from the nearby English Market they informed us.

The wine pairings were quite good; I particularly enjoyed the reds we were served along the two main courses (a lamb ragu pasta, and a pork chop with mushrooms).

The food was above average for ""pub grub,""  but one thing we didn't like was the music (not live) blasting in the venue. My friends were visiting from America and unfortunately we weren't able to have much of a conversation. We had to yell to hear one another cutting out earlier than planned.

The owner and staff are always so lovely and genuinely would go out of their way for you. Over the years I‚Äôve brought loads of friends who had never been before - and now they love Rossini‚Äôs as much as I do üòÖ No complaints keep doing what you are doing!!

Isaac's Restaurant,Cork,"48 MacCurtain Street, Victorian Quarter, Cork, T23 F6EK, Ireland",Fine dining restaurant,4.5,,,,,"Review 1: 4 stars - This place was almost perfect. To start with, they have a great wine selection, with many different options for you to choose from. My husband and I both got the 10oz Sirloins, my steak was cooked a perfect med rare. However, my husband ordered his medium and it came out well done. They were super busy that night, so he powered through it and finished his meal. We were starving and didn't want to wait for another steak to come out. Other than that, the sides were all perfectly seasoned and the desserts were to die for. I definitely suggest getting the chocolate St. Emilion. (by Dustin Hughes) [a year ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Great restaurant yhat we have visited a few times. The staff are great  the place is clean and the food is always good. The building is unique. Always worth a visit.

Definitely recommend and will be back (by Food Lover) [Edited 2 years ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Superb dining experience from start to finish.

The restaurant itself is quite understated, but very elegant. Staff were all welcoming, friendly and attentive - without being overbearing.

But the food was the real star of the show; I had the Vegetable Curry - which was excellent. My son and daughter-in-law thoroughly enjoyed their choices too.

The soda bread (which I believe they make themselves) was by far the best we‚Äôve had during our entire trip to Ireland. And trust me when I say that we ate a lot of soda bread!

Highly recommended, and I‚Äôd advise you book in advance, as this place is always busy! (by Caroline Findlay) [2 years ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Celebrated birthday lunch with my sister's here & it couldn't have been better. Beautiful place. Food was INCREDIBLE. And the service was absolutely impeccable. I cannot rate or recommend this place any higher.

Thank you so much for a wonderful afternoon (by Paula Kenneally) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - We'd only just arrived in Cork when we decided to have dinner here; however we hand't made a reservation so we were prepared to go elsewhere if necessary. The woman who greeted us said she'd check if we could have a table, as they had several reservations and they were preparing for a massive group of teachers to arrive (celebrating the end of the school year). She walked around the entire restaurant with her seating chart, counting and calculating. We were thrilled she was able to seat us, and even with such a huge group coming, our service wasn't affected in the least. We felt very taken care of and our meal was delicious. Once those teachers did arrive, though, the decibel level rose incredibly. With brick walls, high ceilings and open areas, there's nothing to really absorb the sound. So when it's packed with an enthusiastic very large group, it can get loud. But overall I'd say it was a very pleasant dining experience, we truly appreciated getting seated without a reservation, and our meal was great. I'd go again in a heartbeat. (by Julie Schmidt) [7 years ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Fantastic steak. The meat was cooked to perfection, one of the best I ever had. Just a bit bland without any herbs or spice. Great wine available. This is one of the better restaurants in Cork, definitely. If only parking would be possible! (by Sascha Giese) [5 years ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - We had a wonderful meal last night. Very professional and warm service. The menu had a great selection to choose from, and all four of us enjoyed our food. Highly recommend this restaurant. (by Sonia Cribbin) [3 months ago] | Review 9: 3 stars - Was there as part of a work do.  20 plus people so hat tip for accommodating us.  Service was fast and responsive. Ordered the black pudding salad starter which was nice but the pudding a little undercooked (not crispy). Acknowledge this might be a personal preference but still.  Ordered fish cakes as a main and they were not great.  Dry and lacking seasoning. My co workers seemed happy with their mains. It's a good location but wasn't blown away with the food. (by Lugh O Morain) [6 months ago] | Review 10: 1 star - The manager (a red haired woman) was very rude! She believed we didn‚Äôt understand English, she was impolite and hasty.

Il Padrino Restaurant,Cork,"21 Cook St, Centre, Cork, T12 K3KA, Ireland",Italian restaurant,4.4,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 5 stars - Amazing family meal here today. Great atmosphere and attentive staff.  Great range of dishes on the menu.  Food was amazing especially the pasta dishes we ordered.  Would 100% recommend to anyone looking for a great Italian meal out in Cork. (by Mike Briggs) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Loved this place! We got this on a local recomendation and it was a good one. Food was equal to Rome but the hostess and service made the experience great! Highly recomend (by Kevin Lee) [a week ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - I ordered a vegetarian pizza and a hot chocolate.

The vegetarian pizza didn‚Äôt feel like a true, authentic pizza. It was heavily loaded with mozzarella cheese, which completely overpowered the other flavors. While there was a reasonable amount of vegetables, the combination didn‚Äôt come together well. The overall taste was dominated by the excessive cheese, making the dish feel unbalanced and quite heavy.

The hot chocolate was also disappointing. It is advertised as an ‚ÄúItalian chocolate,‚Äù but the flavor resembled something closer to a basic dairy milk hot chocolate. It lacked the richness, texture, and depth typically associated with Italian-style hot chocolate.

Overall, while the presentation was decent, the taste and authenticity of both dishes left much to be desired. (by Shridhyey Gupta) [4 months ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - I visited Il Padrino for dinner as a group of four people.

I would recommend reserving a table. The restaurant fills up with diners very quickly after 6pm.

There is a great variety of dishes to choose from. We ordered Arancini, or deep fried rice balls, and garlic bread for starters. Both were delicious, though we would have welcomed more than two rice balls on the plate.

For the main course, everybody ordered something different: risotto, tagliatelle, chips. We all enjoyed our meals. I had tagliatelle with chicken and mushroom sauce, ""Tagliatelle al Pollo"", which was exceptional and the garlic bread accompanying the dish was nice.

The staff were all friendly and very quick to fulfill our requests for extra water and sharing plates.

One nice improvement to the menu would be the addition of photos of most or all dishes on the menu. It makes it easier for people unfamiliar with Italian dishes to understand what is on offer.

I would recommend Il Padrino to anyone looking to eat out at an Italian restaurant in the heart of Cork City. (by Arash) [a month ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Second time here to this authentic Italian restaurant and it was just as delicious as the first! Everything on the menu that we have tried has been top notch and plentiful.

The only negative I have is the price of minerals at ‚Ç¨3.90 each.

Don‚Äôt let this put you off though. The homely atmosphere makes you feel as though you are in the heart of Italy.

Service was swift and attentive. We will be back no doubt! üáÆüáπ

Don‚Äôt let this put you off however. The service was swift and attentive. (by Eoghan O‚ÄôConnor) [a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - The carbonara is to die for. I'm not kidding. It's the best Carbonara I've ever had, and I've had a few. Pizza was really good, too, and Tiramisu was just amazing. Service is exceptional. We were seated right at the pass where the food came out of the kitchen, and it was so nice to see the whole process (I watched my Carbonara being made and plated just for me). Wine was delicious. The only beer they have is Peroni, but sure, that's not the end of the world. Loved everything about it, the atmosphere, food, service, all 10 out of 10. (by Ieva Loca) [5 months ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - I love this restaurant and have been going here on and  off here for probably 15 years.  Anything I say here is in the context of me liking the restaurant and is meant in a constructive way. The best thing about this place is undoubtedly the staff. They're always friendly and kind, particularly when there are kids involved. I ordered a pizza margherita. The base wasn't ""right"". It didn't have the elasticity and lightness found in a good base. The base reminded me of a sort of crusty bread in texture. Previous pizzas in Il Padrino haven't always been like this, although the last few times they have been. The tomato sauce wasn't pletniful on the pizza and didn't have any tang or basil flavour. The pizza was laden with a salty mozzarella and cheddar. The experience at the restaurant was lovely.  The atmosphere was lovely. The lighting and setting also really pleasing.  I'll always turn here as I've always liked these factors but please give us the pizzas like ye used to make - light, full of flavour, and not too cheesy. I hope ye don't mind the feedback. (by Kevin Byrne) [Edited 2 months ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - The food is enjoyable, I love the risotto here! It‚Äôs always been very busy when I‚Äôve visited but the staff deal with it well and around tables impressively quickly! Have always had friendly and pleasant service too. It is a bit crowded in there with tables being quite close to each other,  but in a way it does add to the character of the place. If you‚Äôre in Cork and like Italian food, it‚Äôs definitely a great place to try. One of my favourite Italian restaurants in Cork.

We ordered pork baby back ribs which has a delicious mouthwatering wet rub, meat are all tender. Rib eye steak was char grilled over fire which has a legit smoky flavor. Serving sizes are huge. Ambiance is cozy, crowds are usually in group of young people. Staff are friendly and attentive. The prices are reasonable, might spend roughly ‚Ç¨25-30 for main + dessert + pint.
However, parking is limited within the street.
Reservations might be needed during the weekends.

The service on my visit though was frankly appalling, slow and slightly shambolic. I was brought the wrong drink, sauces were taken away when we'd requested them to be left (and they then charged us for more later) and menu items were substituted without telling us. Service alone would be two stars, the really good food would be five and will get me coming back if I come to Cork again.

Service is efficient, and the food is colourful and tasty. There are lots of options on the menu. Sitting outside is undercover, and there is a heater on and keep you warm. Definitely a great spot for brunch,l, but if you want to seat inside probably a good idea to book (by Mark McEntee) [Edited 4 weeks ago] | Review 3: 1 star - Last Saturday morning I took my friend to the restaurant for breakfast for her birthday. The weather was perfect, and we were seated outdoors, it was the kind of morning that makes you feel grateful just to be there. We ordered coffees and soon after, our food. The food did take about 40 minutes to arrive, but we didn‚Äôt mind too much at the time since we were enjoying a relaxed conversation.

Unfortunately, things took a turn. About 10 minutes after our meals arrived, a waiter came over and let us know our table had been reserved for other guests and we would need to leave in less than 30 minutes. He explained that the waitress had forgotten to mention this earlier. There was no offer to move us to a different table. It felt rushed and awkward, I genuinely lost my appetite.

About 15 minutes later, the waitress, who was lovely and very apologetic, came back and kindly offered to move us to the side chairs so she could prepare the table for the next guests. We couldn't go inside because we had a dog with us and we totally understood that. We agreed, but sitting there we no longer felt welcome, and I couldn‚Äôt enjoy the rest of the meal. I ended up taking it with me, paid, and we quietly left.

It‚Äôs a shame how the situation was handled, it left us disappointed, especially considering it was a special morning. (by Flor Mendoza Diaz) [2 months ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - Situated in Ballintemple, short stroll from Cork city. Outdoor & indoor seating and they offer takeaway.
Nice welcome on arrival, brunch menu: we went for the French toast with banana almond, chocolate sauce &
Chantilly and the mushroom & Brie skillet. French toast was overly smothered but it was very tasty..
Mushroom dish was delicious and would highly recommend. Friendly staff and prompt service (expect for cleaning away our empty plates)
Reasonably priced and lovely throughout with plenty of fresh tasty deserts to choose from. Nice menu and would highly recommend a visit (by Jasmine Dempsey) [a year ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Had a fantastic brunch here with family.

(by Jamie Sheehan) [a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - They squeezed us in on a busy Sunday morning! Excellent coffee and the best BLT I've eaten in years ... probably helped by the fried egg and the cajun chicken that the waiter suggest was ""out of this world"" - he wasn't wrong.
Going back tomorrow for lunch üòã (by Tim Davies) [3 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Salt is a little cosy restaurant in the heart of the marina in Ballintemple!
It is a great restaurant to swing by for brunch or dinner or drinks! Especially before a gig in P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh!

The Staff:
The staff are really friendly and attentive.
The waiting staff as well as the kitchen staff are very accomodating if you wanted to make a change to the item that you are prdering. Such as the type of bread or maybe not using sour cream in the item that you are ordering, etc.

The Food:
I first started coming here in 2018 and back then the menu used to change daily and with the seasons.
When we visited a few times during las year I noticed that it now seems to be a set menu, well at least the ""La Carte"" menu seems to be set.
I ordered the ""Anticucho Burger"" and my fianc√©e ordered the ""Eggs Benedict"". She modified her order by swapping out the toasted muffin for a slice of toasted sourdough instead!
I thought that maybe ordering the Anticucho Burger at half 10 in the morning would be too heavy but it was bar far the best thing I have gotten at Salt so far!
The chicken was juicy and lightly spiced with beautiful tomatoes, lettuce and a dollop of their homemade Aji Verde!
It was accompanied by their homemade garlic and parsley wedges!
The Eggs Benedict is always a winner when it comes to a breakfast item and the protions are certainly satisfying at Salt! We highly recommend it if you are feeling something hearty for the morning!

Food Note:
Their wedges are really really good and I would suggest ordering them as a side if the item that you are ordering does not come with them!
You won't regret it!
They also list what options they serve that there is a Dairy or Gluten option available, just look at the menu for details.

Location:
Located in the little coner between Victoria Rd. and Monahan Rd.
The area is quiet and I think this plays very well for Salt as there is usually parking close by however, sometimes you might have a short walk.

Layout & Decor:
The restaurant has an outdoor area to the front of the premises and as you enter there is a number of seats at the front with a little elevated den area as well.
The main seating area is located near the front and as you walk throught this area towards the back you will see that there is another outdoor area at the back with more seating.
Both outdoor areas are covered with an awning and there is a heater in the rear outdoor area to keep customers warm.
The decor is unique with pictures, posters, statues, etc.

Booking Note:
If you want to sit inside I would book in advance especially on a busy weekend to ensure that you have a table as the premises is small and can fill up really fast!

Overall Opinion:
Salt is definitely a great spot for brunch or dinner and it is also a good location in the Marina for drinks.
They serve delicious food with a variety of options and its the perfect place on a warm Summer's eveing for a lite bite and cool drinks!
I love it and I highly recommend coming here! (by Thomas Thornton) [a year ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - Amazing place.for brunch.

Milano,Cork,"8 Oliver Plunkett St, Centre, Cork, T12 CK40, Ireland",Pizza restaurant,4.0,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì30,"Review 1: 1 star - I visited Milano on Oliver Plunkett and had an extremely poor experience. I understand that guests should wait to be shown to a table, which I did without any problem. The restaurant was not busy at all ‚Äî in fact, it was quite the opposite.

After being seated and given the menu, I timed exactly 15 minutes waiting for a server to take my order. I even called out to them. The staff were not busy attending to other customers; they were standing a bit further ahead, talking in the back section of the restaurant. I was seated near the entrance.

I raised my hand to call a waiter, and one person said they would come back ‚Äî but never did. In the end, I simply stood up and left. While I have eaten there before and the food was fine, on this occasion I left without ordering.

When I‚Äôm paying for a meal, the minimum I expect is polite and attentive service. I understand if a place is packed and the staff are overwhelmed ‚Äî that‚Äôs perfectly fine. But this was mid-afternoon, around 2 p.m., and the restaurant was empty. To me, the lack of service was unacceptable, and I would not return. (by lidiane alves cardoso) [a month ago] | Review 2: 3 stars - The place was clean and had a nice family ambiance. Great for taking the kids out, having a date or just having a quick bite by yourself. Unfortunately I may had a bad day because the food was not as good as I expected. The risotto balls were excellent but the pasta needed more sauce and the edges were very crisp. The service was great. Maybe I'll try it again next time I visit the city. (by Juan Rocha) [a year ago] | Review 3: 1 star - I can consider it to be the worst gastronomic experience I have had here in Cork so far. I ordered a chicken fillet that was the size of my little finger, and a portion of salad equally shameful in presentation and quantity. It looked like I had left the rest of another customer's dish, it was so ugly and disorganized, it wouldn't even be worth 5 euros, let alone 19.88 euros, which was the amount I paid. I do not recommend. It's throwing money away. If delivery is like this, I won't go anywhere near the restaurant's door. Unfortunate. I send photos, the lemon looked like it had been sucked, how disgusting. I didn't eat anything, I wasted my money. (by Andreia Santos Garcia (Andr√©ia Garcia)) [a year ago] | Review 4: 1 star - Very poor and low quality service. The place has a credit as is on a busy street only.

The bathroom stinks, even can not be locked for privacy. Never would go back!! (by lisa babit) [2 months ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Food was amazing, really quick service and great atmosphere. Lovely server but when taking our starters away he put back our used cutlery onto the table which I thought was strange not a dealbreaker though. The tipping process was uncomfortable as the server just turned around and stood standing beside us as we entered the amount. Great experience otherwise and would go back regardless :) (by Abbi Keane) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 3 stars - Service was great, nice atmosphere, but I was a bit disappointed with the food, usually we have pasta and pizza, no problem, but this time I have tried their sea food and polenta chips. The battered calamari wasn't crispy and it had that thin skin that can be annoying, the polenta chips were mushy, not well fried and the prawns overall was okay, but they were so tiny that I couldn't barely taste it,that is definetely not the standard I would expect for Milano. (by Solano Gadanha) [3 weeks ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Great stuff. Great food and atmosphere. But service takes too long sometimes.

No compensation provided.

Would give the food 0 if I could because I never got it.
Would give the service 0 if I could because we didn't receive any.
Would give the atmosphere 0 if I could because we didn't get the chance to experience it. (by Patrick Farmer) [2 months ago] | Review 10: 4 stars - The pizza here does not seem very traditional but that won't stop you from enjoying it.
They had a special offer where you could get a starter with a main for only (if I remember correctly) ~15‚Ç¨ which is great value!
This place seems to serve food all day so if you're hungry at an awkward hour and like Italian give this place a try.

Great location and a view to die for üëèüçÄ (by Ali Russo) [3 months ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - The ambience here is excellent and the potential to be really great is here but the quality is just not there. I ate here two nights in a row and while the view is spectacular the food quality is just not there. The first night I had the strip loin steak and while that was delicious the sides were just meh and nothing remarkable. Tonight I ordered the halibut and asparagus and while that was delicious the potatoes were bland and flavourless. I tried both the ‚Äúnew‚Äù potatoes as well as the ‚Äúskinny‚Äù fries and both were just meh. I suppose the ambience makes up for a lot but imagine if everything was delicious and you could have the ambience. I am a guest at the hotel and I also had breakfast here and it was not great. It was super slow to be seated and the buffet was not replenished and service was just slow. This is an example of way to busy and not enough staff which is a management problem. For such a great property they could do better. (by Justin Mattina) [3 weeks ago] | Review 6: 3 stars - We recently visited Panorama Bistro and was impressed by the beautiful design and breathtaking views. The dining room provided a peaceful atmosphere, conducive to a pleasant conversation. Unfortunately, my experience was marred by slow and inconsistent service, possibly due to the restaurant being understaffed. I found the server to be efficient yet rushed, and the food took longer than expected to arrive at the table. To make matters worse, one of our dishes never came, yet we were still charged for it. While the prices were steep, the service did not meet my expectations. Overall, the stunning views and well-designed space may make up for shortcomings in service, but at these prices, we expected more. (by Viale M) [2 years ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - We ate here recently while staying in the Montenotte Hotel and it was a lovely evening. The staff were friendly and helpful and nice to the kids. The view over the city is lovely and the food was delicious. The food was a little bit slow coming out from the kitchen but we didn't mind too much as we weren't in a rush and just had a few drinks between courses. (by Trish Lambert) [3 years ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - Panorama Bistro Terrace at the Montenotte Hotel is an absolute gem for any food lover out there. As someone who has visited here twice now, I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of food and the impeccable service provided by the staff.

To begin with, the food is simply divine. Every bite is filled with an explosion of flavors that will leave you wanting more. The only minor drawback is that the food may take some time to arrive, but trust me, it's well worth the wait.

What stood out to me the most was the fact that we asked for a baby bowl for our 6-month-old. It's often hard to find restaurants that cater to the needs of parents with young children, so this was a pleasant surprise.

The staff was accommodating and friendly, and order times stopped to chat when they heard that I spoke Spanish to my baby. You could tell they genuinely cared about making our dining experience a memorable one. The outdoor seating area that offers breathtaking views of Cork city and was packed with people enjoying the lovely weather.

Last but not least, I have to give a shoutout to the friendly bunch of Spanish staff who stopped and had a chat with us. They made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. (by Gabs G.) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 1 star - My husband and I went to eat dinner here and as we walked in the hostess showed us a table she was going to clean off so we could sit and enjoy dinner.   She told us to wait    We waited and she came back to get us and took us to a completely different table she originally showed us.   The table was not what we wanted.  We went to the bar.  The gentleman working at the bar said you can have dinner here but people could be reaching over you , etc. There was NOONE at the bar mind you.   He suggests we sit at a bar table.  We did.. and we waited and waited and no one came by.  We had to ask for a menu.  We got one and then waited more. I suggested to my Husband to leave for the reasons listed above and also the hostess and other waitresses were shunning us.  They were talking about us it was very clearly noticed.   Will never go back here during our stay in Cork. (by Lacy Lever) [3 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Pure excellence. Amazing atmosphere. Indulgent fusion of food.

Kielys,Cork,"4 Maylor St, Centre, Cork, T12 D9W2, Ireland",Fish & chips restaurant,4.7,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 5 stars - Came for dinner with a friend. Small but cozy dining room, they have a few cafe table sets inside and some outside. Tried the Korean BBQ chicken tenders with chips, and they were fantastic. Really nice light breading, crispy chips. The sauces were a Korean BBQ sauce and garlic aioli that went really well with the seasoned chicken tenders. Service was fairly quick, made shortly after ordering and came out hot. Employees were all very friendly and helpful. They do gluten free batter on their fish and chips and regular chicken tenders, and even have gluten free options for vinegar (a red wine vinegar) for those looking on their fish and chips. Tap to pay is available, I'd definitely go back again! (by Justin Wong) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - The fish here is the best cod I've had in Cork.

It was cooked perfectly with a nice thin batter.

The chips were good too. Mushy peas were nice.

The only thing that I though was fine, but my GF didn't think was intense enough was the tartar sauce.

We will definitely be coming back here again.

There isn't a lot of room inside to sit, but there are a few table outside.

Prices were good for the quality and portion sizes. (by Kevin M.) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - Small place with only 10ish seats inside, a few more outside. The cod was kind of small and thin so it tasted mostly of batter. Maybe I shouldve gotten Haddock? Shrimp were pretty good. Fries were nice. Garlic and Togarashi mayo were nice. Good location. (by Russell Hirschorn) [4 weeks ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Kiley‚Äôs is an excellent choice if you want great fish, crab cakes and fries (aka chips).

(by N Roy) [4 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Excellent food and friendly staff. Food very fresh and very fairly priced. Kids chicken nuggets are ‚Äòproper chicken‚Äô.

They accept cash also which is handy if you want to leave a tip. Not many places in the City Centre to get a take away of fish and chips so its gladly welcomed.

The batter on the fish was light and done  excellent the haddock done to perfection.

The portion was very generous.

It was all neatly put into a fancy takeaway carton which kept the meal warm for a surprisingly long time.The old way wrapped in paper would have been just as good.

A very enjoyable takeaway meal. Not many fish and chip shops left at all. The service was quick and friendly. Very enjoyable and tasty meal. (by Mr Walsh) [a year ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - I love the dishes at this restaurant, especially the Haddock. The fish is well-seasoned and not greasy, and it's very well prepared.

Got the chicken tacos and the birria with a side of tortilla chips
The chicken tacos were bland and completely dry considering it was big chunks of meat. the beef birria were good but not amazing there was large lumps of chewy beef too.
Not a good experience and very expensive for what we got and 8 euros for a handful of tortilla chips and a couple of small dips is extremely poor imo.

A pity since I did enjoy their pizza. Maybe an off night all around but I expected better. The pepperoni pizza was overdone and ham and mushroom needed more time in oven.

The drinks were great and the menu was unique. Loved the speak of the devil cocktail, the miso aubergine, and the basque cheesecake! Though, everything was lovely (by Kylee Williams) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Stopped by Cask while in Cork and had a great experience. We ordered a Moretti and a cocktail‚Äîboth well served and enjoyable. The bartender was friendly, knowledgeable, and took time to explain a few of the cocktail options, which added a nice personal touch to the visit. The venue itself is stylish and classy without feeling pretentious‚Äîperfect for a relaxed drink in a refined setting. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for quality drinks and great service in a polished atmosphere. (by Jack Coughlan) [5 months ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Great experience! The atmosphere at the bar is super pleasant, cozy, and perfect for a good time with friends. The staff was very polite and attentive, which made all the difference. The food was really good, but I missed having more vegetarian options on the menu. It would be great to see more variety in that regard. Overall, a very positive experience, and I‚Äôll definitely be back! (by Ana Maria Merlin) [6 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Fabulous food, great cocktails menu - they make to die for Irish Mule. Drink prices are on the high side but we had a sharing board of charcuterie and cheeses that was very good value. (by Brian Hudson) [3 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Everything about Cask was absolutely lovely besides the beef dish that had very little meat and was mostly fat and gristle which is why I couldn't give it the full 5 stars. The ambiance is a 5 star so it's a great place to take a date. The tapas are high quality but I have had better for lower prices locally. Edit... it now has 5 stars all the way with the new dishes!!! (by Luke Ratterman) [Edited 2 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - This place is fantastic. The staff is incredibly friendly, the drinks are the best, and the food is amazing.

Cafe Mexicana,Cork,"Carey's Ln, Centre, Cork, Ireland",Mexican restaurant,4.5,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 5 stars - Absolutely fantastic! Came here for my wife‚Äôs birthday whilst having a weekend away in Cork and everything about Cafe Mexicana was spot on. Food, service, atmosphere all 10/10. The prices are very reasonable too. We would definitely return when back in Cork. (by Nathan Chester) [4 months ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Went here for my GFs birthday it was really good. Let me start by saying we sat right at the door when you walk in downstairs , good seats, but the woman serving was on her own. It took 45 mins from when we walked in to the restaurant  until when we get our food. The only complaint about the food is the Chimichanga was a little bit cold in the middle but it was still super tasty! The Dynamite nachos were very spicy. Ribs were superb, chicken wings were a bit crispy but still very good (by Marty Butler) [a month ago] | Review 3: 3 stars - My family and I were traveling through and hoping for a little hit of authentic Mexican flavor. With a motto like ‚Äúa taste of Mexico‚Äù and ‚Äúauthentic Mexican cuisine,‚Äù I was optimistic. After all, I‚Äôve lived everywhere from the East Coast to the West Coast of the U.S., spent a few years in Texas (for context, not a fan of Tex-Mex), and even crossed the border into Mexico a few times‚Äîso I was ready for something familiar.

Unfortunately‚Ä¶ this wasn‚Äôt it. I‚Äôm honestly not sure what part of Mexico this food claims to represent, because the flavors didn‚Äôt match anything I‚Äôve had. It tasted a bit more like if an Italian and a Mexican got married, raided the pantry, and stirred spaghetti sauce into the beans. My daughter, ever the food philosopher, argued it was actually Indian fusion. Either way, it wasn‚Äôt quite the experience we‚Äôd hoped for. Maybe we should have stuck to the little taqueria we saw down the street.

On top of that, the service left us feeling a bit invisible. We don‚Äôt drink much, so after we were seated and our food arrived, we basically didn‚Äôt see anyone again for about half an hour‚Äîno water refills, no ‚Äúis everything okay?‚Äù Meanwhile, other tables around us were getting checked on regularly. And hey, we‚Äôre a fun family! We would‚Äôve happily chatted.

Oh, and the glassware‚Ä¶ yikes. One of the glasses had stuff stuck to both the outside and inside. When I asked the waiter for a clean one, he just walked over and swapped it from another table. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel bad for whoever got stuck with that trade.

All in all, Caf√© Mexicana has a cool vibe, and maybe it hits the spot for some. But for us, it was a bit of a letdown. Here‚Äôs hoping the next stop on our travels serves up a little more of the authentic flavor we‚Äôre craving. (by Kermit Jones) [4 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Incredible food ... Tidy, cosy little spot with friendly staff and a great varied menu. I'll be back as there was plenty more I wanted to try. (by Rory Kelleher) [4 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - The food is lovely, the chicken wings are delicious.  The baked potato as a starter was good too but it would have been nice to get a whole potato not a half one.
Mains were Carne Asada and chicken tacos both very nice. (by Rosemary O'Sullivan) [4 days ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - I‚Äôm the kind of person who always tells my friends about good places, and that‚Äôs what I did after going to Cafe Mexicana. The service was great, the food was really good, and the drinks were delicious. I really liked it!

(by misterphantomm) [2 weeks ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - I want to say that the food has met our culinary expectations, the atmosphere is cozy and full of culture, even considering the music that transcends and walks between folklore and the most recognized for Spanish speakers, since it was a great detail, without a doubt they made us feel at home despite the great distance from Chile üá®üá±. Finally, I would like to mention that we were served by a beautiful, kind and warm woman named Alba who with her charisma brought us several smiles and made the evening even better ü´∞üèª (by Michael Z√°rate) [5 months ago] | Review 9: 3 stars - We were surprised by the good reviews, as our own experience was disappointing. The staff and atmosphere were nice, but everything we ordered (nachos & tacos) was covered in tomato sauce and lacked balance, leaving only a tomato aftertaste on the palate. Having tried Mexican food in different places (including Mexico City), this was not what we expected. (by k√ºbra Keles) [4 weeks ago] | Review 10: 1 star - We got a table for 2 rather quickly; however we waited over an hour and only ever got our drinks and appetizer.

They have a few tables outside and plenty of seating inside (there‚Äôs an upstairs loft as well). Toilets both on the ground floor and upstairs.

Would definitely recommend stopping in for breakfast! Everything was delicious. (by J S) [Edited 3 months ago] | Review 3: 1 star - DO NOT RECOMMEND!
First time i came here food was great, the second and third time i came it was absolutely disgusting! (wanted to try it again as i thought it would be as good as the first time)
both times, they messed up our orders!
i ordered pancakes with compot- they gave me pancakes with bacon, when i addresssd the issue they just took the pancakes in the back and brought out the same pancakes just took the bacon off and added the compot on top!it was misserable!
also ordered an iced mocha and it was not drinkable! the chocolate was all sank at the bottom and wasnt melted with the coffee, it had bits of chocolate floating around!
my eggs benedict came out with a bit of bacon and 2 eggs on a piece of bread, it had no rocket or garnish or anything- it looked dead!
i am very dissapointed with everything- for the price of ‚Ç¨60+ i expect them at least to know how to make a presentable plate and a decent iced mocha!
Absolute RIPP offf !! will never return and will never recomend to anyone! (by Rebecca Petre) [a week ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - We arrived at the end of a busy Sunday service. It was a bit hectic with lots of items missing off the menu. I don't think this is the usual experience so I'll need to visit again to compare. Nonetheless, the food was really good. We ordered the breakfast bap and the avocado and toast. The avocado and eggs in particular was great. The addition of the peanut and sesame rayu made it extra special (we even bought a jar when we were leaving).

We ordered two scones, a hot chocolate, and tea‚Äîall delicious. Service was impressively fast. The tea came with a pot and cup, and the scones were served with butter and jam, which added to the flavor. The atmosphere was wonderful. For 3 scones, 1 hot chocolate, and 1 tea, I paid ‚Ç¨17.30, which felt fair for the quality. The place is across to City Hall Q-Park if you need a parking space. (by Gulsum Seref) [11 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Great spot for a takeout coffee and pastry. Coffee is very good and the pastries I‚Äôve tried have all been delicious.

Definitely stop in if you‚Äôre in the area. (by Kevin McCabe) [a year ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - I've been living in Cork for a while, often passing by The Bookshelf. The exterior always caught my attention, as it is very beautiful and well decorated. For my birthday, I decided to make a reservation and... I couldn't have chosen better! üçª

You have plenty of options on the menu. We opted for the Avo & Eggs, which was exquisite. If you order it, be aware that the Rayu is spicy; you can request it on the side if spice isn't your thing. We also ordered the Korean Chicken Burger‚Äîlooks spectacular, tastes even better.

The service was super friendly. Before leaving, Mark thanked us for choosing the restaurant and invited us to come back. We'll definitely return!

The Market English was really good. Scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked and the Coughlan's Sausages were really tasty. Would be really nice if there were beans in there too (maybe instead of the black pudding). The portion size was really big.

The Field Mushrooms & Roast Tomatoes | Parmesan | Sourdough Toast was lovely. A good portion.

Ice latte was good (no sweeteners available) but orange juice was a really small portion.

Might I suggest the Rebel Red. Couple of them and soon you‚Äôll forget all about the insurance you had to buy from the rental car company.
The vibe was perfect too. There is outside seating where you can actually have a conversation and hear. And to top it off, Pompeii Pizza is right there. Probably the second best pizza I‚Äôve had in my life!!!
So quit him hawing around and get yourself over there! You won‚Äôt be sorry! (by Scott Lee) [6 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - This is one of the best places to have pizza and drinks.

We got there on a Tuesday, right after the restaurant had just opened and the place was empty. The waiter gave us the menu and, not even 3 minutes later he came back asking if we were ready to order. We also ordered one appetizer and two main dishes and the appetizer came 5 minutes after the main dishes.

Food-wise, the Chicken Katsu Curry Don was pretty good, but I feel the balance between the rice and the curry could be a bit better. There was too much rice for the amount of curry on the dish.

My partner really enjoyed her Aburi Salmon Don.

The highlight was the Tori Karaage, which was incredibly tasty and the sauce that comes with complemented well the dish.

Overall, it‚Äôs a pretty good place to grab some hot japanese food, but it could improve a tiny bit.

The hosomaki I got was brilliant but there was more fish in a ‚Ç¨5 salmon (8 pieces) hoso than the ‚Ç¨16.50 chirachi bowl, don‚Äôt waste your money on it.

The waitress brings our starter (8 pcs chicken wings) with a tray, and while picking up the plate, she dropped all the pieces of chicken on the ‚Äú‚Äùdirty‚Äù‚Äù tray. Instead of brining it back to the kitchen she just picked up the chicken one by one with her HANDS and put it back on the plate and served it to us. I‚Äôve never had this happen to me in a restaurant..
While ordering I had specified to bring the starter first and then the mains. My girlfriend‚Äôs main arrived 2 minutes after the starter was served.. Mine arrived 10 minutes after that.. so not even at the same time..
As a result the food was half cold when we got to it.

Great to see that we finally have more Japanese food options in Cork.

All the dishes we tried were amazing, the timing of the foods were great, the service and the atmosphere were also great.

We ordered a sushi plate to start with salmon and squid, and then we had several donburis as the main. Spectacular! (by Romeu Hayashi) [a year ago] | Review 10: 1 star - We ordered sushi here and waited over 40 minutes. We asked the server and he was unconcerned as he said it would be here soon. It did not come soon. We asked the waitress again and she said ‚ÄúA lot of sushi orders came in when you ordered‚Äù as though that was a legitimate excuse. It wasn‚Äôt even busy. Then she had the nerve to suggest we order appetisers while we waited to make up for the fact that our food hadn‚Äôt arrived?! Make it make sense.

After so long, we asked to pay for our pitifully small teapot of green tea and leave. The waitress responded to us leaving the restaurant without eating due to waiting so long with ‚ÄúI‚Äôd do the same if I was you.‚Äù That is so unprofessional? It was unbelievable.

Would not recommend this incompetent restaurant that can‚Äôt deal with more than one table at a time. Stay away.

Fingas - Afro Restaurant and Lounge,Cork,"20 Pope's Quay, Shandon, Cork, T23 X568, Ireland",West African restaurant,4.3,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 4 stars - For a start, the name Fingas shows in the variety they offer in the menu.
The ambience, the cultural embrace is absolutely worthy of note.
The smile you meet while coming into the place and as you enjoy your meal is amazing.
The meals accommodates different taste buds and as the only African restaurant I am aware of in Cork, I repeat visits.
However, the meal prep could use some alterations.
The staff tries to accommodate people‚Äôs choice but some factors remains.
Although most of their meals come out fresh, some of the ones I have tried  seems not so fresh.
For the price of the food, considering how expensive African foodstuff costs, they can try to offer more off the pot, fresh and hot meals.
Thank you to the owner for the initiative, thanks to the chef that makes the amazing meals and the wait staff especially my personal favourite Te amor( I‚Äôm sorry if I didn‚Äôt get your name correct).
I will keep coming and bringing more friends because the ones that have come so far, love it . (by Loveth Chidimma Ani) [5 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - The Gizdodo was so good, rhe dodo was so soft it basically melted in my mouth, the Gizard was a bit tough but that's just my teeth I love my meats baby soft.

I'd give it 9.5/10 cause of the Gizard but that's just my teeth.

Meatpie was so good, not a lof of filling but thats to be expected since it's just a starting restaurant. The pastry was so good it was so soft and sweet and it paired really well with the filling.

10/10 I wish there was more than just 2 but I'm glad there was cause i had toom for more food.

Egusi was nice, like I was tempted to lick the bowl it was so good. It was so good, best part was the portion I got had no fish and minimal fish bone so I was even happier. The poma (can't remember the spelling) was so good it melted in my mouth and the meat was so soft I love it.

10/10 I wish I licked the bowl.

My sisters thoughts on the Ogbono. It's very good. Which from her is a 10/10.

She was almost as fast as me when eating her food. I tried some of the Ogbono and it tasted do good.

So overall, i would rate this Restaurant 10/10. Will be coming here everytime i come to the city. (by Yewande Ladejobi) [6 months ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - I came here for some African cuisine and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The food is good and the service and politeness of the owner and chef is excellent. The food is a bit expensive for what it is but I understand it‚Äôs only opened up and finding it feet.

I know things are still only being set up but from what I can see this place has serious potential!

I will definitely come back down when I‚Äôm in Cork next. (by Sele Clement) [6 months ago] | Review 4: 1 star - The Owner of Fingas wanted to beat me up a (woman), I was given what was not described in the menu and questioned it.

I visited Fingas restaurant 19/05/2025  and ordered Egusi and pounded yam. I asked the waiter what protein comes with the meal she stated Assorted is in the soup, I asked if I could order goat meat, she said I could get it as a side.
The food came,  I started to eat and noticed Ishan was a lot in the soup and stock fish. I was talking to the friend I came with to the restaurant that I‚Äôm not happy about this , they stated assorted expecting beef, Abodi, Roundabout, shaki and the likes.

A man approached me and said what the problem was I said I don‚Äôt like the protein it‚Äôs hard and it‚Äôs not assorted, he said to hold on and called the Owner. The Owner approached me and asked what the problem was I said this is not assorted this is just hard Ishan parts in my soup, I further stated that the likes of shaki,abodi, roundabout, beef was what I knew as an assorted mix.
He said, we don‚Äôt serve Abodi here rudely and don‚Äôt provide it, I said okay , but beef is also absent in the soup, he said they have beef, but they don‚Äôt have Abodi repeatedly and Rudely, then  walked away.

My Friend and I kept on speaking on how rude he was and didn‚Äôt even ask to rectify the issue. The owner came back and said, what is still the problem ,that he has said they don‚Äôt have it and I should leave the food if not pleased with it and was pointing his finger in my face and coming close to me while speaking
This escalated from 0-100 I stood up for myself and said he should never  point his fingers in my face, I‚Äôve not said anything wrong, he spoke to me rudely and walked away and I didn‚Äôt say anything. I felt bad about how he had responded to my complain but decided to keep cool only for him to walk back to my table a second time and pointed his fingers and asked me to get out of the restaurant. It‚Äôs really sad that I was not treated with the minimum respect that a customer deserves to be treated with. Nothing was done about my complaints, I was disrespected, I don‚Äôt  think anybody deserves to be treated like that.

Maybe he is frustrated and is breaking down under pressure but I don‚Äôt think it should be taken out on customers. (by layi Olatoye) [4 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Food is good.

The food is amazing and it is exactly as if you are eating in Thailand. If you like Thai food and want to experience Thailand then this is the restaurant to come to. I would highly recommend eating here. Booking in advance would be my recommendation.  They don't do Pad Thai from Friday to Sunday which is important to note. But the menu has plenty of other options to choose from. It is truly an amazing restaurant. We will be back. The cost included 2 glasses of wine. If you want genuine Thai Local food this is the place to come. No other place in the country comes close to this restaurant. it is also a great place to do take away if you don't want to book to eat in. Excellent Restaurant.

EDITED TO REPLY: Order was by phone for collection: Spring rolls/Chicken Massaman/Jasmine rice/ Udon Noodles-Black pepper beef. A complaint could not be made as you were closed so I completed this review immediately on the day. We are not living within the delivery area.

The food, like duck and chicken, might come with bone (do ask). The Hong Kong style roast duck is really tender, the crispy chilli chicken and the pepper beef are really good too.

The staff were really nice and helpful too, to give advise. (by Karan Samani) [6 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Great place for really tasty Chinese food that is outside of the standard fare. The fish in the sea bass and pickled cabbage soup was remarkably fresh and the portion was generous.

(by Felicity Roberts) [4 years ago] | Review 4: 2 stars - I have loved the aesthetic of Lafayette's since I was young. I rarely leave bad reviews however the standard of food is not up to scratch of that of a 4star hotel. It is clear that the majority of staff are given no training and that there is no clear management system. The last few times I've visited (I keep going back cos I love the decor in there and am always rooting for it to be a good experience). Service is slow and poor. The woman sitting at a tablw near me with a child was left waiting ages to be served, then had to ask for culery, a portion of chips came along for her table. She then had to ask when the rest of the food was coming - she had orderd fish and chips. The one excellent and compentent server had to check on it for her. After the two had finished we had a quick chat. She said to me after that they didn't even bring the right sandwich for the child but she didn't have the energy to say anything.
My own order was a glazed ham and melted brie sandwich. At least that it what the menu said. What arrived was a plain slice of bread with relish and cold slice of brie, topped with a deli sized slice of ham. The portion of chips I ordered on the side came along first, with the server saying ""Enjoy your meal,"" instead of saying ""Is there anything else I can get you?"" Having seen the experience of the lady near me, I too had to enquire if my sandwich was on the way.
This quality and service as mentioned above does not reflect the quality and standard expected from a 4 star hotel. If management of the hotel is reading this, please take time to train your staff properly i.e. getting an outside agency to train them rather than relying on more senior staff to do it and/or hire more staff.
I would recommend you take a look at how one of the city's other 4 star hotels trains and manages their staff i.e. The Metropole.
Thanks for reading,
I hope it is useful feedback to help you to improve your service. I want to reiterate that when a place is understaffed and undertrained that this is never the staff's fault but management's fault.

The staff were exceptional! So kind and considerate. My meal came  SO fast & thank goodness for that because I was starving.

My salad was fresh and tasty! Nice chunks of avocado too.

My chicken supreme was SO SO GOOD! I normally don‚Äôt eat cauliflower so I gave it a taste tonight and ended up eating it. That goes to show on how well prepared everything was right down to the cauliflower.
Highly recommend when in Cork! (by Fan Girl) [5 months ago] | Review 2: 2 stars - I was staying at the hotel for work and came to the restaurant hoping for a quick dinner before a busy evening. Unfortunately, the experience left a lot to be desired. There was no one to greet me when I arrived, and I stood waiting for about five minutes before another guest kindly informed me I should just seat myself. I wasn‚Äôt given a menu and had to go to the bar to ask for one.

Service was very slow ‚Äî it took a while for anyone to take my drink and food order. I ordered the pork belly and waited around 45 minutes before checking in, only to be told there had been delays due to a fire drill earlier that affected the gas supply. This hadn‚Äôt been mentioned when I ordered.

When the food arrived (after about an hour), it was just okay. The pork belly was unfortunately overcooked and quite dry. I had originally planned to stay for dessert, but decided it wasn‚Äôt worth the extra time.

If you‚Äôre staying here and hoping for a smooth, timely meal, I‚Äôd recommend looking elsewhere. (by Karina W) [5 months ago] | Review 3: 3 stars - Though the service was friendly, it was sparse and you had to wait a long time to get a drink or your order taken. Pints were overpriced.

What really made this whole experience even worse was when I was finished and we paid our bill we sat in the seating area of the lobby to finish our drinks and as we were heading back up to our room we were stopped by a staff member and asked to come back in to pay for our meal that we just paid for which of course technically is a false arrest. (by Robert Mills) [a year ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Typical hotel restaurant bar. Pasta bolognaise was marvellous. The city could have been better. The deserts were delicious. I went to this restaurant with my family after it had poured in cork. I would go again. (by Caroline Zerweck) [11 months ago] | Review 8: 1 star - The service in this restaurant tonight was appalling. At entrance, no one was there to seat us so we had to find our own seats. We waited around 15 minutes to even receive menus, even that we had to call a second waitress over to get them as the first one we called over never ended up giving them to us even though she said she would. The food was acceptable, but the service did not create a pleasant or enjoyable atmosphere. We later received our food and waited an extra 10 minutes whilst eating to receive our drinks. I also received the worst pint of coors I have ever seen in my entire life, the head on the pint was paper thin and the pint overall tasted funny. The bartender agreed with me that the pint did not look right but didn‚Äôt offer me a new one just topped up the head on the same pint instead. When we finished our meal, I stood up as no one was coming to us to offer us a dessert menu and walked to the entrance where there was a waitress. I asked her for the dessert menu and she then begged me to sit down and said she would bring one to me. At the end of the night the waitress handed me the bill and asked me to please check the bill? I have never been asked this before, as expected the bill was wrong and I was being charged for items I did not order. She then reprinted the bill and asked me to check it once again. When I confronted one of the staff for the unacceptable waiting time she told me to ‚Äúmaybe book tomorrow instead‚Äù. This was not a great experience and I am very disappointed in the restaurant and its staff as the restaurant was not busy at all and I would not be recommending this restaurant to anyone I know. (by Abbie Fagan) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 3 stars - Food was good and staff were polite enough but have to echo other reviews complaining about level of service. Was not greeted at entrance after 5 mins then asked for a table. It was not busy.  Would expect regular check ins by servers especially after having a finished  plate for 20 mins to ask if anything else needed or the bill. Finally approached cashier on my own and paid and left without staying for dessert or another drink. (by Glenn Hill) [a year ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Always nice to eat here and have a drink when I‚Äôm staying at the Clayton. Great food & excellent service, thanks a million Elise!

Fab food, fab service. Reasonably priced..particularly given the large portion sizes. Very much enioyed and left with full bellies. Mobster themed restaurant which added a nice touch - dishes for all tastes. The skillet brekkie was particularly good. Look forward to visiting again when in Cork City.

(by Lenny McCarthy) [3 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - We‚Äôve been to Tony‚Äôs many times and it‚Äôs always a wonderful experience! The first time my husband and I went was years ago when we had just met, later I went with my mum, and nowadays we go as a family with our little boy. My husband never misses the chance to say how much he LOVES the cappuccino. Our 2-year-old son eats an entire plate by himself (generous portions!) and they always bring coloring pages and crayons to keep him entertained.

We especially enjoy going on Sunday mornings when it‚Äôs not too crowded. The traditional Irish breakfast is absolutely delicious ‚Äî we highly recommend it! (by Heloisa Marmiroli) [a month ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Ordered breakfast served in a hot skillet and it came with coffee or tea. Loved the food, but could have a bit more spice or garlic. Since the breakfast was on top of potatoes, we both would have preferred an Italian pastry instead of toast. This restaurant is in an older area of Cork city but the inside is small and charming. We plan to return to try something else from their breakfast menu. (by Robert Schuppert-McDonald) [Edited 7 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Best breakfast I have in Ireland. We were a group of 12 guys. So accommodating to changes on the menu and very patient. Tara our waitress was an absolute star. Can‚Äôt recommend this place more. Food came out fast and very tasty. Even let us pay the bill separately (by Tal m) [2 weeks ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - BEST BREAKFAST IN A LONG TIME.

We stumbled across this on a day trip to Cork whilst looking for somewhere to get breakfast.
They weren‚Äôt actually open but the hostess kindly let us sit at a table and then order 15 minutes early.

I had the eggs Benedict and it was excellent! Eggs perfectly cooked, sauce beautiful! All on sourdough bread too.

Service was flawless!

Definitely go there you won‚Äôt be disappointed (by Adam Williams) [7 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - If you‚Äôre searching for a proper Irish breakfast that warms the soul as much as it fills the belly, look no further than Tony's bistro. From the moment you walk in, the cozy atmosphere and welcoming staff set the tone for what‚Äôs about to be an exceptional meal. The Irish breakfast here is a masterpiece.
What makes Tony's Bistro stand out is the balance of authenticity and quality. The ingredients taste fresh and locally sourced, and nothing feels rushed. Portions are generous but not overwhelming, leaving you satisfied without being weighed down.

We were booked for afternoon tea for 3pm for my friends belated birthday. Our server was very attentive, remembered I mentioned we were meeting for my friends bday and brought out a bday plate for my friend. We got a mocktail on arrival and honey pot when leaving. These touches are so nice, and I'll be recommending the venue to friends and family. I'll be back soon, such a relaxing and nice spot. All the staff were very attentive from the girl at the desk to the server. You don't get good customer service like this anymore so it was so refreshing.

The only reason I didn't give the food 5 stars was because I found 2 bones in my Hake Fillet. I'm aware fish have bones but wherever I eat fish I expect no bones. Its just a personal thing.

The staff (Maria B) recognised us on our second visit and was very welcoming. We then had Beppe on our second visit and he was also very friendly and both were great with the kids.

While it looked and sounded good it was the worst pizza I‚Äôve ever had. It was soft (I expected a crunchy base) and not properly cooked through. The cheese was tasteless. Very disappointing all round (by Sheryl Walpole) [4 months ago] | Review 6: 2 stars - nice location , pizza and beer are always a good combination. however, do not go here if you are vegan. they make their own vegan cheese so this sounded nice and after seeing reviews I was quite looking forward to it. went with a friend and we got two pizzas, shared half the pulled jackfruit option and half a margherita.
The whole texture of the cheese was wrong and was as if it was dolloped onto the pizzas , making globs that would nearly flop off the slices when picking them up. I started just letting them roll off so my stomach wouldn‚Äôt turn any further eating the slices..if I had a knife I would‚Äôve spread the cheese balls over the pizza cause the overall taste was nice in the cheese and the sauce. the base was great // cooked well.
Please just find a different way to apply that cheese to the vegan pizzas ..I will not be back, but for future customers, please do them a favour.

The pizza is poor to average at best, it fills a hunger gap but very careless approach to preparing the pizza. The toppings are carelessly prepared and the cheese is not spread on the pizza.

The Friary,Cork,"62 Shandon St, Sunday's Well, Cork, T23 X499, Ireland",Irish pub,4.6,,,,‚Ç¨1‚Äì10,"Review 1: 5 stars - The Friary is without question my favourite pub in all of Cork city!
Mike and his wonderful staff have a really unique vibe going on between the decor and their game nights. I guarantee you'll have a great time in the Friary and enjoy one of their wide selection of local beers on tap or in the fridge.

The Staff:
Mike is a brilliant Cork publican and he is easy to spot if he is there as he'll be the man with a brightly coloured shirt and long wavy hair. Both he and his staff have created a unique pub with a very casual atmosphere on the corner across from the North Gate Bridge where you will feel right at home with yhe locals.

Events:
There is always something going on between the weekly Wednesday quiz and any number of fun filled events that take place on the weekends. There is always a raffel after the Wednesday quiz and usually the top prize is either a Nicholas Cage or a Keanu Reeves themed pillow cover or t-shirt.
You'll definitely find something that will tickle your fancy.

Layout:
The main bar is on ground level with seating at the bar as well as tables and chairs along the wall. There is also additional seating upstairs however, choose wisely if its a Wednesday night as there is fierce rivalry between the two levels.
What I find a bit unique for a Cork pub is that the restrooms are located downstairs.
There is a small amount of seating out front of the bar which is lovely on a nice sunny day to enjoy a cold drink.

Decor:
This is a unique pub for Cork as it is decorated with everything that is Nicholas Cage! From movie posters to homemade 3-D printed heads this pub has got it all.
They regularly have game nights where new decorations are added to the walls and ceiling so what is there this week may have changed by next week however, Nicholas Cage remains a constant.

Drinks:
They don't serve the mainstream beers here but what you will find is a wide variety of local and not so local beers both on tap and in can form.
Personally I'm a stout and cider guy but I have come to love the Indian Summer beer and Kirin Ichiban beer along with the Stag Stout to name a few.
If you want someyhing a little stronger they also have a wider variety of local distiller's whiskeys, gins and vodkas so there is something for everybody.

Overall Opinion:
Over the years I've come to love many pubs in Cork but none as much as the Friary! It has a unique feel to it and they make you feel right at home.
I highly recommend stopping by Friary's for a drink of your choosing and have a good auld chat with bar staff and you won't be long making friends! (by Thomas Thornton) [6 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Great little bar with a trendy crowd, great selection of only craft beer. Staff are lovely and the vibe is great.

The unique decor is cozy old tavern filtered through a teenage boy's bedroom, I'm glad i didn't encounter any crusty socks, but I'm not sure if I'd have been surprised if I did. Good selection of liquor as well as a fanatical devotion to the master thespian, Sir Nicolas Coppola. Great Craic! (by Travis Brink) [a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Excellent pub! I cannot put it into words how much the atmosphere, regular patrons and the staff make this one of, if not the best, pubs in the city of Cork! The lines are spotless, the pints, crisp and sharp and the spirits selection can meet almost all tastes. If you‚Äôre a fan of whiskey and or IPA‚Äôs, you‚Äôll be happy as a pig in shit.

(by Adrian o) [5 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - So there I was, in a 5 star hotel restaurant, waiting for my wife to enjoy and finish her company party. I had driven her 2.5 hours down in the afternoon and had a late night assignment to bring her home later that same night. It was gonna be a long night, so I went to the restaurant as I wanted some food.
I walked up, got greeted by the incredibly friendly staff, and given a table.
All around me were well to do people in beautiful suits and dresses, and here I was in jeans and a Reindeer Christmas jumper. I felt out of place. My server, Jelmer , let me know that the typical thing to do was to get one of each course and it included drinks and desserts etc etc. and it was going to cost far more than I was looking to spend.
Here I was just looking for a plate of chips and veg.
I felt like I was taking up a spot for someone willing to pay the expected amount. I nearly left there and then, apologising that I misunderstood what the restaurant was and worrying I was making a fool of myself.

However, any fears I had were quickly relieved when I explained myself to Jelmer. He alleviated my worries and worked with me through the menu and how to best take care of me. He assured me that I was just as much a priority as anyone else. I have a plant based diet and he didn't skip a beat. Without a worry or hesitation, he helped me through the menu and what I wanted.

A few minutes later, after some nice, soft bread with delicious dips, I was enjoying the FINEST vegetables and chips I had ever had. And very nice portions, too!

The service from not just Jelmer, but all the staff like Davar, made me feel more at ease, relaxed.
I was smiling the whole time I dined there. What better experience can you ask for?
I don't know what they do to get such great staff, but they are a credit to the Manor.
I had never heard of this place before, but now it's where I will recommend anyone looking to spend a night in Cork if they want a classy, friendly and relaxed experience.

I didn't even spend ‚Ç¨17, and I am stuffed.

Thanks Jelmar, and all of his wonderful co-workers. Including the lovely lady who helped me find a table with no prior notice given.
You made me feel very welcomed and comfortable. It means so much to me. (by Declan Ryan) [a year ago] | Review 9: 1 star - ""Disappointing Experience ‚Äì Bland Food, Overpriced, and Poor Service""

We visited this restaurant with high hopes for a nice family meal, but unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. There were four of us, and we ordered a variety of dishes to get a good sense of what the menu had to offer.

We started with the Goat's Cheese Mousse Salad, P√¢t√©, Arancini Balls, and Chicken Salad. All were incredibly plain, overpriced, and lacked any real flavour. For starters, these dishes could have been served at any budget restaurant, but here they were marked up far beyond what they were worth.

For the main course, we went with the Duck (‚Ç¨40), Lamb (‚Ç¨40), and Dover Sole. The Duck was dry, bland, and came with just a few baby carrots and flavorless potatoes. The Lamb was overcooked and equally tasteless. The Dover Sole was completely dry and lacked any seasoning or richness.

What really left us feeling deceived, however, was the price. We would have been disappointed with the food even at a lower price point, but when you‚Äôre paying ‚Ç¨100 per person, it‚Äôs simply not acceptable. To make matters worse, the service was lacking‚Äîstaff didn‚Äôt even bother to serve our wine, and our Calypso Coffee arrived cold.

The only redeeming feature of the evening was the Margarita cocktail, which was actually quite nice.

We will definitely not be returning. When you're paying premium prices, you expect premium food and service, and this restaurant failed to deliver on both.

After taking a chance with the non descriptive menu we ordered what read exotic. After having hardly finished our meal the plates were cleared off the table. No questions asked or any exchange of decency, we asked if we wanted to pay cash or pay by card.I told the waiter could we two minutes please. That we were given and within two minutes the same waiter came out from behind the curtains and said ‚Äú have you finished and will you pay by cash or credit.‚Äù My family were taken surprised by waiters attitude throughout the evening.

From the moment we arrived, the atmosphere was incredibly inviting. It struck the perfect balance for networking and relaxed socializing.

The food deserves a special mention. The BBQ  was delicious, well-prepared, and served with attention to detail. It's clear that quality ingredients are a priority here.

The service was impeccable. The staff were attentive, friendly, and efficient, ensuring that every need was met without being intrusive. This level of professionalism is exactly what you look for when planning a corporate gathering.

And the DJ? Absolutely fantastic! The music selection was spot on, creating an energetic and enjoyable vibe that kept spirits high throughout the evening. It added an extra layer of fun without overwhelming conversations.

Stretch Tents Ireland (by Jack Smiles) [Edited 3 months ago] | Review 5: 1 star - Very disappointing experience at the Beer Garden
My husband and I had a very unpleasant experience with the bar staff at the Beer Garden. It was around 10 PM and the bar was not crowded. My husband raised his hand to get the attention of the bartenders ‚Äî all three of them saw us clearly waiting to place an order. We stood at the bar for 20 minutes, but none of them came to take our order. They were chatting among themselves and completely ignored us.
When I finally approached them to ask why we were being ignored, one of the bartenders responded very rudely, saying he was ""too busy"" unloading clean glasses from the dishwasher. When my husband questioned his priorities ‚Äî whether clean glasses were more important than serving customers ‚Äî the bartender said the glasses were more important.
To make things worse, one of them insulted me by saying he couldn‚Äôt understand me because my English was bad. For the record, I speak English very well.
We were really looking forward to enjoying the atmosphere, but unfortunately, the staff‚Äôs behavior ruined the evening for us. The only positive thing I can say is that the music was great that night.
I sincerely hope the owner of this place takes this feedback seriously and takes appropriate action. I also hope there are security cameras in place so the owner can review the behavior of their staff and judge for themselves. We were there on August 2nd, between 9:00 PM and 10:30 PM.

Thank you. (by Diana Nozdracova) [2 months ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - A very spacious pub that has an outdoor area attached to the back of the premises. That can be covered or uncovered to suit the weather. You will get a pint or a coca cola for around ‚Ç¨6 euros. It also has a few bar counters that are in use most of the time and for busy occasions. Food is also served in the deep south and is definitely worth a visit. Very busy staff that are unbelievably quick at serving at busy times. Prices are averagely expensive and in line with other pubs due to high vat and increases in the hospitality sector in Ireland.

Cafe Spresso,Cork,"26 MacCurtain Street, Montenotte, Cork, T23 YF57, Ireland",Cafeteria,4.7,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 3 stars - Our first breakfast in Ireland had to be a full Irish breakfast, of course. I found Cafe Spresso, which was a short walk from our hotel, and it had pretty good reviews. It was a Monday at around 11 AM, and there was probably only one other table dining. The menu looked like it was a mix of Irish and Hungarian cuisine. We ordered the large Full Irish Breakfast (2 bacon, 2 sausages, 2 eggs, black and white pudding, mushrooms, beans, tomato, toast, tea or coffee) and one of the Hungarian specials, a meat croquette, which comes with a cup of beetroot soup. The Irish Breakfast was good - oily, like you‚Äôd expect. It did the trick. It‚Äôs enough to share between two people, just because it‚Äôs so greasy. I would skip the croquette. It was definitely left over from the night (or maybe more) before. It was soggy and salty. I did enjoy the beetroot soup, but I didn‚Äôt want to mix too much of it with the coffee I was already drinking.

Cafe Spresso is a good option for a full Irish brekkie, which is only ‚Ç¨12! But I would just stick to that. (by Melanie Tam) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - The best cafe in the country.

Walking in, I was impressed with how lovely the place looked. The d√©cor is modern and stylish, giving it a welcoming atmosphere that makes you want to sit and enjoy your meal.

The staff were pleasant and polite throughout my visit, though I did feel they could have been a little more attentive at times. Nothing major, but small details, like checking in more often or being quicker with service would have made the experience feel that bit smoother.

As for the food, the eggs Benedict was nicely presented and the portion size was just right for a brunch dish. The salmon was fresh, and the eggs were cooked well, though personally I found the overall flavour quite salty, which took away slightly from the enjoyment.

The orange juice was delicious and tasted freshly squeezed, but at ‚Ç¨4.50 for a small glass, it did feel overpriced compared to the rest of the meal.

Overall, it was a pleasant first experience. I‚Äôd recommend. (by R√≥is√≠n) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Beautiful food on the top floor in the calmer section of Brown Thomas.

The second time the amount of haloumi was minimal and that cost 11.50 with one slice of toast and the third time there was a decent amount of haloumi which cost 11.95.

Unfortunately, things didn‚Äôt go quite as expected.

First off, we were told over the phone that a bottle of Prosecco was 27 euros, but when we got there, it was suddenly 39 euros per bottle. And to top it off, we had to carry the bottles to our table ourselves, basically self-service even for the Prosecco.

The barbecue was decent, and the food was okay. We had booked for around 15 people, but only 12 actually had the barbecue. Still, the manager insisted we pay for all 15 portions because they claimed the food was already prepared. I get that, but it would‚Äôve been nice if they‚Äôd told us upfront that they‚Äôd cook for 15 no matter what. At least then we could have figured out a way to use the extra food or save it for later.

We spent the whole afternoon and evening there, eating and drinking, which added up to quite a bill. When it was time to pay, I asked the manager if we could take the leftover food for dinner since we‚Äôd paid for it. What they gave us was really disappointing cold, dry meat that seemed like it had been out for ages, just wrapped in foil with bread. No chips, no salad, nothing. Given that we paid for the full menu, it felt really unfair.

All in all, the service, especially from the manager, was pretty poor, and it felt like they didn‚Äôt care much about the customers. It was a letdown, especially for such a special occasion.

(by Jason Anthony Biggs) [a month ago] | Review 5: 1 star - I had a deeply disappointing and upsetting experience at this bar last night. We had a table reservation for 8 PM, and our friends arrived gradually due to work and other commitments. The last few arrived around 11:30 PM and were greeted by the manager in an extremely rude and, frankly, racist manner. He told them this ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt a community centre‚Äù and that the bar was already closed.

At that point, they were already greeting us at our table‚Äîit was obvious they were part of our group. We were still drinking, and at no time had anyone informed us that the bar was closing. Had we known, we would have arranged a different meeting point for those arriving later.

To make matters worse, the bar was still full of customers at other tables, and no one else seemed to be treated in the same way. The way we were spoken to and singled out made us feel humiliated and disrespected. It was clear to us that we were being treated differently because we are not Irish.

No one should ever be made to feel unwelcome or discriminated against in a public place. I sincerely hope the management takes this feedback seriously and ensures no other customer has to go through the same kind of experience.

Food was very tasty and the crowd around us was lively. (by Fan Girl) [5 months ago] | Review 9: 1 star - I've been going here on and off for a number of years with work events. Today was is the first time ever that we've been refused a pint of water(while also ordering drinks). It was 23+¬∞ and we had collectively spent about ‚Ç¨300 so far that evening. The bar person/manager proceeded to shout at us for having the audacity to order water... We will be taking our business elsewhere from now on. We are all business men and women. It is astonishing that water is a bode of contention. (by H H) [a month ago] | Review 10: 1 star - ""Treated Like a Burden After Spending ‚Ç¨150+""

We visited on a Wednesday evening, expecting a relaxed meal and drinks. Instead, the atmosphere was tense from the moment we arrived. The manager was loudly berating staff in front of everyone, shouting ""Empty hands! Empty hands!"" as they worked. It was incredibly uncomfortable to witness, and I genuinely felt sorry for the employees‚Äîno one should be treated like that, especially in public. If this is how he acts in front of paying customers, I dread to think how he treats his team behind closed doors.

After collecting our plates, less than ten minutes later, he abruptly told us, ""Get out."" We had planned to stay longer and enjoy some drinks, having already spent over ‚Ç¨150 as a group. That one rude and unnecessary comment completely changed the mood.

We‚Äôve never been berated like that in public before. It was humiliating, and we left feeling like we‚Äôd done something wrong simply for wanting to enjoy our evening.

This was a truly disappointing experience. Until there‚Äôs a serious change in leadership and respect‚Äîtoward both staff and paying customers‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone.

Good Day Deli,Cork,"Located within, Nano Nagle Place, Douglas St, Cork, T12 X70A, Ireland",Cafe,4.7,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 5 stars - We had a lovely meal at Good Day Deli ‚Äì a hidden gem tucked away amidst lush greenery. The setting is beautiful, with the outdoor seating area offering a peaceful escape and a close connection to nature. The food was absolutely delicious and great value for money. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, checking in regularly to make sure we had everything we needed. The calm, serene atmosphere makes it a perfect spot to unwind away from the city‚Äôs hustle. We‚Äôd definitely love to return sometime! (by keerthi m nair) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Nano Nagle Place was a really pleasant surprise. It‚Äôs this calm little spot right in the middle of Cork, with a beautiful garden, peaceful atmosphere, and a great mix of history and modern design. The restaurant there is cozy and stylish with big windows, lots of natural light, and a laid-back vibe.

It‚Äôs quit a pricy place, but really nice one. Great for a quiet break, especially if you're already visiting the museum or just want a chill place to eat in Cork without the usual noise. Definitely worth dropping by if you‚Äôre in the area. (by VlaDrive) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Elegant cafe in the grounds of Nano Nagle Place. I had a delicious Buddha Bowl, the weather was sunny, the gardens lush and green, the service excellent! I‚Äôm an Aussie, so I do wonder if the ‚ÄúKiwi Lamington‚Äù, though!! (by Jennifer Smith) [3 months ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - Good food, good location, great service, what more could you want? This caf√©/restaurant is located in the courtyard of a former monastery, accessible via some rather steep stairs. But climbing them is worth it, because Good Day Deli is a true gem.

The small and modern hut offers indoor and outdoor seating, and as it was a sunny day, sitting outside in the sun was the best possible option. The brunch menu is rather small, but I'd say you'll definitely find something here. I opted for the pancakes that come with a hibiscus poached pear and coconut mascarpone. Not a big coconut fan but in combination and moderation it was good, and the pancakes were great. Wasn't too impressed with the price of their coffee, though.

I was recommended to try this place by locals and it was the very first thing I did after arriving in Cork. Go and try their brunch, it's really an experience! (by Philip Ziche) [6 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - ""A place that inspires, feeds and transforms lives.""

The food displays high-level techniques and has incredible flavours.
Wonderful surroundings with a beautiful garden and flowers.

Sun Tzu once said ""The water that flows under the rocks is purer than the water from the clouds.""

I don't know what he meant by that, but this place is gorgeous and makes the best breakfasts and brunches in Cork City. (by Zacharie SOLD) [6 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - If you are willing to spend a bit more than the usual price for a breakfast, you can have a truly delicious experience here. Like chef-level type of experience. Not to mention that the place is spacious and luminous, the views are fantastic, the service is top-notch, and you can have a lovely walk through the gardens (and the nun's cemetery too). And learn some history. (by Bruno Unna) [3 weeks ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Good Day Deli is a great spot for a tasty brunch! I had the Turkish eggs with an extra side of halloumi, and the food was absolutely delicious‚Äîwell-seasoned and perfectly cooked. The only downside was having to sit indoors due to the windy weather, and the acoustics inside made conversation a bit of a challenge since you had to raise your voice to be heard. Still, the food was worth it, and I‚Äôd definitely go back! (by Anahita Shaikh) [6 months ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - I enjoyed my visit to Good Day Deli at Nano Nagle Place. However, the high prices of the dishes were unexpected.

I ordered the fish tacos on their weekend lunch menu. It was served with homemade chips and accompanied with a herb aioli where there was a choice between herb and chipotle aioli.

The fish tacos were delicious and the chips were cooked perfectly and just like how I would cook chips at home, not overly greasy. The aioli tasted great too and I ended up dipping my chips into it.

The staff were kind and very knowledgeable about the menu. The atmosphere was superb, sitting indoors was like being in a log cabin in the middle of a nature reserve full of plants and trees outside.

Over ‚Ç¨20 for fish tacos did startle me at first, especially given that main dinner courses at restaurants around Cork are usually around this price nowadays. However, the local supply of ingredients and friendly service justified this cost.

I was surprised to find a seat on this day because within minutes of me sitting down, the shop was full and a queue was at the waiting area. I would recommend making a reservation on weekends if you are concerned about having to wait around peak meal times.

I would highly recommend Good Day Deli if you are in Cork city looking for lunch or a meal prepared from local ingredients, surrounded by nature. Just be prepared for a big bill. (by Arash) [2 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Really beautiful place in gorgeous gardens. Not very well signposted so was slightly difficult to find. Food was beautiful and quick to arrive! Heaven for gluten free and veggie people. It was super loud inside though so we had to raise our voices to talk. One main downfall was the only option for plant based milk was oat which isn't gluten free so I couldn't have a proper coffee :( (by Klara Murphy-Moylan) [2 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - In August 2024 I enjoyed every single time I were at this memorable place, the food, the coffee, the service and atmosphere, all was great. I felt home  while I was on my short trip to Cork because of this beautiful place.
I would like to say a big thanks for the lovely owner Clare, for being kind and welcoming to her guests. I won't forget you and the tasty food.

(by Denis Byrne) [4 months ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - Popped in with my wife on a Saturday evening and wow was it busy!!! A great sign for a place right?

First, the food. The menu is very interesting with an excellent selection. I had pickled muscles for start, and the rump for main. The pickled muscles were tasty, but somewhat lacking the actual flavour of being pickled. The Rump was a touch overdone and not served with a side which was surprising. My wife had fried oysters to start, and steak tartar for main.

I see in other comments that the owner has defended the cost while talking about challenging prices in the business. I would see this as fair, however, it would stand to reason that serving a steak in sauce and nothing else with it is a somewhat sad looking plate. If other business are managing a little something on the side, it may be worth taking a look at how the dish is presented here.

The atmosphere was busy, however downside of this was that it would be easier to hold a conversation next to a screaming toddler than here due to the mighty background noise. This is not really the fault of the restaurant as it is the size that it is, just be aware that you may need to perfect your lip reading before arriving.

The staff were lovely and very helpful so a big thanks to them!

Would I come back? No, too loud but that is just a me problem. (by Alan O'Brien) [a month ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Superb meal for my brothers 30th last night.

Quinlans Seafood Bar Cork,Cork,"14 Princes St, Centre, Cork, T12 K2HW, Ireland",Seafood restaurant,4.6,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì40,"Review 1: 3 stars - I noticed this seafood restaurant was pretty popular, so I stopped by for lunch. I ordered a half seafood chowder and a half sandwich, but the portions were much smaller than I expected. The menu said the sandwich could be shrimp or smoked salmon, but the shrimp was sold out, so no choice there. Luckily, the smoked salmon was really good‚Äîdefinitely a nice surprise!

The seafood chowder, even as a half portion, was tiny and way too salty. I usually love seafood chowder, but this one was a bit overpowering.

The service wasn‚Äôt great either. I asked for a recommendation, and the server seemed impatient and cold. Even when other customers sat nearby, the same cold, short attitude continued. Really a shame. (by Carrie Guo) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - I made a reservation here at Quinlan's on 17th September 2025 based on Google reviews.
I was not disappointed. The place looked and smelled amazing.
I was seated by the kitchen so I could see the chefs busy at work. The head chef was very friendly and said if I needed any advice just ask. The waitress was also very friendly and with hers and the head chefs advice I went with the Dingle Bay wild squid for the starter which was amazing and such a good portion, possibly the best portion of deep fried squid I've had before. For the main I went with one of the specials, monkfish wrapped in pancetta with scallops. Oh my god that meal was amazing and well worth the ‚Ç¨38 for that course. By the end I had hardly any room left so I just had a single scoop of ice cream.

Overall the staff and food were amazing. Thanks again to the head chef for being so friendly and informative. (by Simon Hopley) [2 weeks ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Absolutely incredible! We didn‚Äôt have a reservation but we got seated right away in the late afternoon for lunch. The staff were friendly and welcoming.

The pan fried salmon was gorgeous- perfectly cooked fish and refreshing salad and cous cous that came with it. Highly recommend!!

The black sole on the bone was very good, though pricey at ‚Ç¨40 (market price). It came with a few potatoes but no greens so we ordered the side of market vegetables.

Overall very happy with our meal! Would definitely come back. (by J S) [3 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Absolutely fantastic food and wine.

(by È¶ôÁπî) [2 months ago] | Review 6: 3 stars - I had Quinlan's Seafood Bar bookmarked because I wanted to try some seafood while in Ireland, and it was near our hotel. It's hard to go out to dinner when you've been out exploring all day, and have a jetlagged 8 month-old. So we decided to order for take-out. We had:

-Homemade Seafood Chowder (chunks of fresh & smoked fish, prawns and mussels with diced vegetables in a seafood cream sauce and served with brown bread) - too salty, but the brown bread really helped
-Traditional Beer Battered Fish and Chips (with real potato chips served with a lemon wedge & tartar sauce, homemade mushy peas & curry sauce) - this wasn't bad but I wouldn't recommend it for takeout
-Pan-fried Filet of Seabass (pan fried fillets of sea bass with shrimp and mussels' risotto, white wine, marinated tomatoes & pea shoots) - the seabass was good, but the risotto was very salty

Overall, it seems like the seafood is pretty fresh but they are heavy-handed on the salt here. I think a dine-in experience would have been much better - just be sure to tell them to go light on the salt. (by Melanie Tam) [a month ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Food was excellent and the staff were very friendly.

I had the calamari to start and a red mullet and scallop main course. With dessert and a coffee. The service was quick and the food was served quickly. Delicious seafood.

We then had wanted something we had seen online, scallops and monkfish but apparently this had been on a previous specials menu and was not now available.
Our backup choice was scallops and white pudding which was on the starter's menu. They kindly upsized for us and we had with a delicious salad and chips.

No salad on it except for a couple of measly onion slices. So bland and dry.

It was rather welcome, the base being very good, I validate this basic and well executed dish.

I got a bad tang of one bite sausage I left the whole lot there. Only ate the fried egg and toast, the worse food I ever ate I haven‚Äôt eaten in 7 hours after it in so much stomach pain. I had to take my mom to bathroom asap after it ripped her tummy apart..staff were pleasant nice restaurant but stay well away , waste of money and you suffer for it.. ROTTEN ! (by Mairead Raymond) [4 months ago] | Review 10: 1 star - On a wet Saturday morning my husband and I went into The Pantry Caf√© in Merchant‚Äôs Quay for breakfast. We don‚Äôt eat meat, so I asked if we could just have eggs and toast. The girl said yes, but only scrambled was available. We ordered two portions with tea.

When it arrived, each plate was just one slice of toast with a small spoon of scrambled egg on top with some mini cherry tomatoes we did not ask for. The total came to ‚Ç¨27.98 ‚Äî I was shocked. I even asked if it was a mistake, but was told no, that was the correct price.

Nearly ‚Ç¨28 for two teas, two slices of toast and a tiny bit of egg is outrageous. To make matters worse, we noticed the Dunnes caf√© just outside offering a full breakfast with tea and toast for ‚Ç¨5.50 each. If only we had seen that first.

It completely spoiled our morning. We won‚Äôt be back, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone who values fair prices and decent portions.

Small and cozy Syrian decor, lovely atmosphere, heartwarming hospitality by the staff.
I had their Syrian coffee while I waited for my order and was promptly served in no time.
Delicious cup of strong coffee with hints of cardamom boiled in a traditional cezve/ibrik/rakweh.
It was the best middle eastern coffee I have had outside of Turkey/Dubai/Qatar.
Sadly did not have a chance to dine in for the complete experience.
The kofta was excellent, I had it with rice and the house pairings.
Would definitely visit again. (by Bernard Goh) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Some of the best Syrian food I‚Äôve had outside of Syria

Food: Renowned for its traditional Syrian dishes, the restaurant serves standout items like falafel‚Äîdescribed as ‚Äúcrisp, fluffy, surprisingly moist interior, bristling with deftly deployed flavour‚Äù  . Other popular choices include chicken shawarma, lamb kabseh, and fattoush salad, all praised for their rich flavors and generous portions  .

Atmosphere: The setting is warm and inviting, featuring Arabic accents such as ornate shishas.  It attracts a diverse crowd, creating a communal and lively environment  .

Service: Staff are noted for their friendliness and attentiveness, enhancing the overall dining experience  .

Located near the Butter Museum, The Four Liars is a hidden gem that delivers a genuine taste of Syria in the heart of Cork. (by Karthik Radhakrishna) [4 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - the food the service,  everything was just amazing. I loved the place üíóüíóüíó

Ichigo Ichie Bistro and Natural Wine,Cork,"5 Sheares St, Centre, Cork, T12 RY7Y, Ireland",Japanese restaurant,4.4,,,,,"Review 1: 2 stars - This restaurant is an airless casual wine & soba bar, not a fine-dining, high-end Japanese restaurant. No sashimi, sushi, or really anything that we were expecting.

I reserved for the ""main bar counter,"" about a month in advance as it is advertised as a chef's counter. It is instead a server station/overflow space where all we witnessed was three gals struggling to pour a pint.

Menus are cheap paper with a long (tiny printed) specials board listed on a chalkboard. It is recommended to take a photo of these specials on your phone & ""zoom in."" We were not walked through anything despite saying it was our first time. I have never been asked to take a photo of something at an upscale restaurant in my life. Service was poor. Food was boring and expensive. For a bistro with a long list of specials, I would have expected to hear about a few of them. And for a wine bar, maybe a pairing could have been suggested.

I would have rather spent our night in Cork anywhere else. (by Katherine D) [4 days ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Genuinely the nicest food I have ever had and I am fond of food. It was phenomenal from start to finish. The staff were very friendly and highly knowledgeable. Lovely atmosphere, ticked all the boxes. Will most certainly be returning! (by Ian O Flynn) [a month ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - I‚Äôve been a loyal customer since the original Michelin-starred Ichigo Ichie, and I‚Äôve returned six times since it transitioned to a bistro. Sadly, I have to say the experience has become consistently disappointing ‚Äî especially in terms of service.

The food is fine ‚Äî average at best ‚Äî but my expectations have always been shaped by the excellence of Miyazaki, the owner‚Äôs other restaurant, which continues to deliver exceptional food and truly warm, professional service.

At Ichigo Ichie Bistro, however, the service is consistently cold, inattentive, and at times even rude. For a restaurant at this price point, that‚Äôs simply unacceptable ‚Äî I‚Äôve received much better treatment in far more casual places.

What happened tonight made me finally write this review. When I politely pointed out that there was a bug in my wine, the staff dismissed it as ‚Äúsediment.‚Äù When I asked for a fresh glass, it was served with visible tissue paper residue on the rim. When I raised that concern, the server responded with an eye roll, which completely ruined our evening.

I‚Äôve tried to give this place many chances out of respect and past loyalty ‚Äî especially as a regular at Miyazaki. But unfortunately, tonight made it clear that the real issue isn‚Äôt the wine ‚Äî it‚Äôs the attitude of the staff.

I truly hope the team reflects on this. Cork deserves better from a restaurant with this heritage.

(upload some of the photos I took before) (by G W) [3 months ago] | Review 4: 2 stars - Before visiting Ireland, I did research on restaurants in Cork and I booked this Japanese restaurant weeks ahead because it is recommended by the Michelin guide, has positive reviews on Google and the food photos look great too.
I have visited Michelin starred omakase restaurants in Tokyo, Kyoto and Fukuoka, and I would always book counter seating as it is usually where the actions take place. With this idea, I booked counter seating for me and my companion. Upon arrival, we were surprised to see that there was no chef behind the bar, not even a bartender‚Ä¶ the chef came out twice but avoided eye-contact with us, which I found odd as it would be seen as rude in Japan.
When we were given the menu, we were surprised not to see any sushi/ sashimi on it because we saw it in the photos on Google. My friend asked the waitress and she said they used to serve it, but now they no longer serve it. From the reviews and photos, we were misled to believe that it is a fine-dining restaurant, so it was a disappointment to see only soba/ udon/ donburi, all the standard fare in most Japanese restaurants.
We ordered a duck dish to share, which was quite big but slightly chewy. My tempura soba was ok but the broth was too salty for my taste. However, my companion was very upset about her Karaage don because she said that her rice was soggy. Rice is crucial in Japanese cuisine, so this is basic stuff, and yet they did not get it right. The ambience was not lively even on Sat eve, though the staff were friendly, it was a disappointing dinner for us as we had high hopes for this place. Out of all the restaurants we visited around Ireland in 2 weeks, this was one of our least favourite and I think people need to check out their recent photos/ reviews rather than the ones left 5-6 years ago as it has changed immensely since. (by Rebecca L) [2 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - This is the pride of Asian cuisine, the finest Japanese dining experience here, and the place that best comprehends the essence of Japanese cuisine. It is a stroke of good fortune for Cork that with this great chef's presence, you have the opportunity to savor the most exquisite Japanese delicacies.

I feel compelled to share this: most of the low-scoring reviews do not truly apprehend the soul of Japanese cuisine‚Äîthey are, in fact, strangers to its depths. This is hardly just or reverent. For those unacquainted, abstaining from critique or choosing not to patronize would be more graceful than feigning expertise.

I cherish this establishment through every iteration of its journey, and I hold in the highest regard the chef‚Äôs profound dedication to the delicate art of creating exquisite culinary masterpieces.

I earnestly wish that the quality of reviews by Cork‚Äôs residents might be uplifted. Let us transcend ignorance and subjectivity, and refrain from offering casual critiques. While sharing your experiences, please honor the meticulous efforts of the restaurant with due respect. (by Yi Fang XIA) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 3 stars - The place is lovely. The service was good but a little too long at first, we waited 40 minutes to get drink and starters.

The starters were delicious, very tasty ! I definitely recommend the pork.

The udon butter soup was good but I did not find Japanese taste in it. The rice and grilled salmon were very boring and not tasty.

We enjoy some Sake that was good but very expensive, I am not so sure if it was a special Sake but for sure I did not understand the price. (by Marina Bournel Bosson) [8 months ago] | Review 7: 2 stars - A deeply disappointing dining experience ‚Äî not recommended.

This was, unfortunately, one of the worst dining experiences I‚Äôve had in Ireland. The issues started immediately upon arrival ‚Äî despite having a reservation, no staff greeted or guided us to our table. With only two other tables occupied throughout our entire visit, it was unclear why we were asked to arrive at the oddly specific time of 5:15.

We were placed at a bar counter that had no activity whatsoever ‚Äî no bartender, no food prep ‚Äî just an empty, static space. Strangely, we were squeezed next to two other guests with plenty of open seating elsewhere, making the experience feel unnecessarily cramped.

The restaurant doesn‚Äôt offer a set menu ‚Äî everything is √† la carte ‚Äî which made the rigid 5:15 or 9:00 p.m. booking slots seem arbitrary. The ambiance was also disappointing: loud music and a noisy environment that didn‚Äôt remotely reflect the serene or refined atmosphere you might expect from a Japanese dining experience.

What stood out most ‚Äî and not in a good way ‚Äî was one of the servers talking loudly and non-stop to the guests beside us. Her voice dominated the entire space, making it nearly impossible for us to have any conversation of our own. We had come for a special occasion, and instead, spent the evening feeling frustrated and unable to enjoy the moment.

The food and drinks were average at best. While the pricing wasn‚Äôt outrageous, the overall quality did not justify the cost. And as a final note: don‚Äôt bother dressing up ‚Äî the restaurant allows people in flip-flops, which really takes away from any sense of occasion. If you arrive dressed for a nice evening out, you‚Äôll likely feel awkward and out of place.

One last detail: if you're aiming for an authentic Japanese experience, please don‚Äôt serve sake in whiskey tumblers ‚Äî it felt careless and out of place.

Overall, this was a missed opportunity and not somewhere I would return or recommend. (by S Chan) [5 months ago] | Review 8: 2 stars - Very similar experience to those listed; was expecting a 'Michelin star standard' experience and was very disappointed. The service was excellent but the prices for the standard of food were astronomical in comparison to what you get.

An extremely underwhelming wagamama or soba springs to mind. (by Thomas Kelly) [a week ago] | Review 9: 4 stars - We went for for a special occasion in September. Wanted to go here last year when they had a michelin star- their menu and over experience was different. Unfortunately couldn‚Äôt. This year they changed the entire set up and menu. Small and cozy place. They have special menu for the day like 5 starter and mains apart from their regular menu which i liked. Their regular menu had limited options. They offer high quality food. I personally loved the sushi in their special menu and the dessert matcha panacotta. Others were also good. But i felt like their take away restaurant Miyazaki had more options- i liked it better for it. If you are going to for drinks, they have a bar set up which was nice (by shalu kumaravel) [a year ago] | Review 10: 1 star - The price and quality are very disappointing. The UNAGI YANAGAWA, which is too salty and you can‚Äôt taste the original flavor of the eel. It was different from what I tried in Kyushu. The TENZERU SOBA soup is too salty, and the soba noodles are also too soft. The fried prawns are not up to standard. I can‚Äôt believe this is authentic Japanese food! I also lived in Japan for almost two years, and it was really disappointing!

The service was also very poor. Because it was a birthday dinner, we ordered a bottle of wine. We were told that we could only dine for 90 minutes that day. We exceeded it by about 10 minutes, but our wine was not finished yet. The waiter kept rushing us. Secondly, it was disappointing to see that another table, arriving at the same time as ours, was not rushed while we felt hurried. It created a negative experience for us.

I strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT due to the steep price of their service and food.

Kitchen's hours are strictly 5pm - 9:30pm 7 days a week with the exception of Saturday where it operates 3pm - 9:30pm. Staff were friendly and nice but the service was very slow when we would ask for something. Keep that in mind regarding the hours.

Spice Bag Loaded Fries we're pretty good, definitely very heavily spiced, and a large portion. Fish and Chips were also solid. The breading was much thinner than most other dishes I've had and the tartare sauce was more watery, more like regular mayo. Solid overall.

(by Danny Walker) [4 months ago] | Review 8: 1 star - Server when seating us refused to talk to me and would only talk to my partner despite me walking in first. It was table service only. After the second drink our server just stopped coming over. She served the tables either side of us, looked at our empty glasses and then walked away. This happened at least 3 times over the space of 45mins. After about 30 we tried waving to catch her attention. Moved up to the bar to try and get served and was ignored by the staff again.

We were perfectly sober, weren't rude in the slightest and were drinking relatively expensive whiskey.

Bunsen,Cork,"4 French Church St, Centre, Cork, T12 K4XN, Ireland",Hamburger restaurant,4.6,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 5 stars - A very tasty burger at the Bunsen restaurant, ordered just the plain burger to see how it tasted. It is a very big burger and for the price at almost ‚Ç¨10 euros with the cost of living gone so high and vat rates for business. I have to admit it was value for money.
The burger was cooked to perfection and nice and juicy and was served by two great attentive and welcoming waitresses.
Also ordered the chips and was glad to see a very large portion served as a lot of places are serving very little. Plenty of seating inside and outside. Service was nice and quick the time it took to cook the burger was the waiting time.
Your table is also served with a big jug of fresh cold water which is an extra nice part of the service. There is also a nice selection of condiments on your table for free such as different sauces and mayonnaise. The staff were great and had pride in their work. It has a nice simple little menu if you like your burgers I would recommend trying the food and service here. (by Mr Walsh) [4 months ago] | Review 2: 3 stars - Have visited this establishment many times and it's good to see it's still a staple in Cork.

Good place to bring indecisive eaters if you're inclined üòÖ
Usually seated right away depending on time of visit.
Good for a quick bite.

Personal pet peeve:
- Acknowledgement of 'tips' during payment: find it odd for a fast food to bring it to your attention about 'Tipping'.
It's almost as if it's expected for someone doing their job, that they're already being paid for?
Imagine applying that to every other profession.

Really put me off from visiting the establishment and especially, if you've been to Bunsen since they've opened and their burgers used to be priced from ‚Ç¨7; find this practice to be really strange.

Normally when you look at a Burger menu they have it written underneath what's in it. Yes there was topping section in the menu but it didn't say anything about cheese so i thought all burgers had cheese in it which i was wrong.

My husband and I stopped here for a quick breakfast on the way out of Cork and ended up having some of the nicest breakfast sandwiches we‚Äôve ever had. The lady was an absolute legend and made me a vegan breakfast sandwich worth raving about. Nice chill atmosphere, good coffee and an all-around lovely spot. (by Daniella Beccaria) [2 weeks ago] | Review 2: 2 stars - This Cafe was recommend to us but unfortunately it was a complete miss‚Ä¶ The service lady was lovely yet, I‚Äôm sorry to say, the coffee was not enjoyable at all. The food was okay, and the place is cute. And I really love the vibe of Shandon Street. So all in all a place of character and comfort, yet not for a good coffee. (by Rosalba Johanna) [a month ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - This caf√© is just too cute! It also served the warmest breakfast I had in Cork. About a 10-minute walk from the city center, and the interior is full of charming handwritten signs. They offer lots of omelette options and a full breakfast menu.

I had Jane‚Äôs Brekkie‚Äîheaping portions drizzled with maple syrup, the perfect mix of sweet and savory. If you‚Äôre not that hungry, they also have smaller bites like croissants and other bakery treats. The owner is super kind and friendly, taking their time to make you feel welcome. Didn‚Äôt try the coffee, but I‚Äôd definitely recommend stopping by! (by Carrie Guo) [a month ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Got the full Irish breakfast here and really enjoyed it.

(by ted jones) [3 months ago] | Review 5: 1 star - My wife and I are on a kick of trying as many places to eat around us as possible. Most are good, some are really wonderful. This experience was bizarrely bad. Like, weird-bad. The tea was cold, the toast was burnt to a crisp, the pancakes were cool and wet (I've never seen this before).

The lady behind the counter was nice and there was nothing negative in the mood, the food was just... bad. I'm no great cook, but I'd never serve anything like this to my wife on even the most basic level of being warm and not burnt. The eggs were smashed and crusty. It was like your child bringing you breakfast in bed on your birthday. Really odd. (by Blake Norton) [2 weeks ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - We discovered this lovely gem during a visit to Cork.

(by Louise Bou) [10 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Just arrived in Cork and found this amazing little place right around the corner from our hotel.

(by Jackie Dodd) [11 months ago] | Review 9: 1 star - We were so looking forward to trying the breakfast here. Drove from 30 min away because of the reviews. Nice date out... Got to the cafe no one around, eventually figured out that there was a bell to ring. Not a great welcome, we seemed to be bothering the man who was on the back. Ordered our omelettes, flat white and water. Dirty glasses, got a cold latte instead of flat white and after 40 min wait with no one in the cafe, got our burned omelettes. So disappointed. First time goggle reviews have let me down. (by Luana Deane) [7 months ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Massively overrated. Coffee was poor and customer service was appalling. Woman just kept grunting at us. Went to coffee scape and the contrast was absurd. Brilliant customer service and coffee. Give this place a skip. Reviews are only so high as it's a political cafe.

The starter was a tasty, home-made vegetable soup. I choose the roast turkey & ham with mashed potatoes & boiled vegetables for the main course in a nice gravy & I really enjoyed it. The desert was a hot, rice pudding served with raspberry sauce & cream. That was delicious too. The final course was between a coffee or tea. We ordered a pot of hot water & milk as we brought our own decaffeinated tea. They do not serve alcohol but instead you get a jug of free tap water.

The service was excellent & the waitresses are very patient & helpful in explaining what is available, The blackboards with all lunch courses are prominently displayed at both the grould floor & first floor entrances.

The restaurant is easy to find on the main shopping street just around the corner from the English Market in the centre of Cork.

There‚Äôs both indoor and outdoor seating, giving it a relaxed, social vibe.

We treated ourselves to a delicious pizza from Burnt Pizza, followed by a juicy burger and crispy chips from Smash Burger. For drinks, we had a creamy white chocolate mocha from Soma Coffee, and wrapped it all up with a beautifully smooth vanilla milkshake.

(by Jack Smiles) [a week ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - A nice different market to experience in cork other than the marina market which I'm sure takes all the attention. I really liked the vibe in here and how it felt more permanent of a place. It would be great if it was bigger but I can see clearly why it isn't. Only issue I have is that it is hard to find parking. That's nit really an issue with the place at all though. (by Ciaran Chestnutt) [6 days ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - Really cool food court in a warehouse, loved the post modern vibe and the restaurants built in containers.
We had dinner with pies, served with mash and pickled veggies. They were amazing and flavourful, unfortunately one of us got sick after the vegetarian one. Still, recommended if you look for a quiet place out of the city centre.
We did not find no alcoholic beverages so don't expect them here (by Giacomo Corti) [a month ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - First time here and my only regret is that I haven‚Äôt been before.
We had the Chicken and Bacon Souvlaki (skewers) meal deal from Taste of Home unit.. absolutely delicious, so fresh and filling. Staff were lovely as well and all for just ‚Ç¨15 with a drink.
In addition we also had a spicy Neapolitan pizza from Burnt, it wins hands down for one of the best pizzas I have tasted in years!
Could not  recommend The Black Market any more highly.  We parked in the overflow car park with no issues whatsoever‚Ä¶ just be aware of the speed bumps there which are hard to see.

(by Allen Odonoghue) [a month ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Really liked this little spot and can imagine it being a very busy place for lunch time, given the surrounding commerce in the area. I was a bit early, at around noon, and there were only a few patrons. There were only 3 spots open when I was there‚Ä¶Dips Asian, Brendan‚Äôs Burritos, and Soma Coffee (which also serves breakfast I believe). There is LOTS of bench seating and it seemed to be dog friendly with bowls of water available.

And olive oil marinated mixed olives, split a tasty crispy thin crust pizza, and had the patatas braves (take or leave the sauce, but the potatoes were perfectly crispy outside and hot inside). And the dessert was also good. But most of all the smiling and sunny service, the lovely outdoor seating, and the generous wine pour made this place a treat after a day of sightseeing.

Our server was exceptional, she notified that us that the kitchen was closing soon so we were able to order our meals. I had the lamb stew and debated finding the chef that created this culinary masterpiece to give them a hug. üòò

The entertainment/band that night, May 3, was legendary! To say our group loved the singer and band would be an understatement, we completely adored them!!! (by Fan Girl) [5 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Fabulous food and great atmosphere. Tasteful quirky decorations make the place look interesting too. Had the Mac and cheese and traditional Irish stew. (by Holly Kinsey) [3 months ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Popped into The Oliver Plunkett for a bit of lunch and really enjoyed it. We had the roast pork sandwich, which was packed with flavour and came with a nice bit of gravy on the side‚Äîproper comfort food. Also tried the spice bag, which had a great kick to it and was perfect for sharing.

Had two lovely pints of Guinness to go with it all‚Äîpoured just right and went down a treat. The place had a good buzz about it, friendly staff, and a nice laid-back vibe. Definitely somewhere we‚Äôd go back to next time we‚Äôre in Cork. Might even try a few more things off the menu! (by Jack Coughlan) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - After going for a tour around Cork City we stopped at The Oliver Plunkett, very welcoming staff and great service. We both had the sandwiches which were amazing and very filling.
We then came back that evening to see the live music and both performances that evening were brilliant. The atmosphere from all the staff, locals and visitors were amazing and the staff were very friendly all night and looked after everyone.
I would definitely stop by again the next time I'm in Cork City! (by Oliver Baker) [4 months ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - The smoked salmon was presented well and the chicken sliders weren‚Äôt half bad either.

Band was good. Overall the restaurant was noticeably dirty and the bathrooms were exceptionally dirty. Service was probably the worst I‚Äôve ever experienced. I won‚Äôt call out the persons name on here but they got our entire order wrong, never checked on us once after dropping the food off, and took almost 15min to track down to get our check.

NORTH at The Address Cork (formerly McGettigan's Cookhouse),Cork,"Military Hill, St Luke's, Cork, Ireland",Bar & grill,4.1,,,,,"Review 1: 2 stars - We had a family group of 16 celebrating an 80th birthday here. The setting was lovely, and the service was solid, our single waiter handled the large group with care, was friendly, and got all the orders right, which we really appreciated. Unfortunately, the food didn‚Äôt quite live up to expectations. We all ordered from the main menu, and while the dishes varied, the general consensus was that the food was average at best. A particular letdown was the ‚Äúseared lemon sole fillet‚Äù which turned out to be just deep-fried fish in batter, more like pub grub than the refined dish the menu description suggested. To her credit, the manager acknowledged our concerns and made adjustments to the bill, which we appreciated. Still, for a venue like this - a 4 start hotel, the kitchen needs to up their game. Nice atmosphere, good service , but the food fell short of the mark. (by John Riordan) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - You will wait a long time for your food but I can only assume it's because the lit hen where they make delicious food is super small and everything is from scratch. The best toastie I had in Ireland came from here and it featured onions and red cheddar. Yum! (by heather notarangelo) [2 years ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Lovely place and amazing food.

The location itself is nice with all these books surrounding you that help create a cozy atmosphere.
The outdoor area is very nice with a bit of view of Cork.

In terms of food you MUST try the seafood chowder and the steak burger.

Absolutely recommended! (by Isabella Salvia) [3 years ago] | Review 4: 2 stars - Stayed in hotel and foot injury meant I had to stay in to dine one night. Both courses had elements described on the menu missing with no explanation. Veg overcooked. Bland food. Wish I had paid for a taxi into town instead. Staff were good. (by Geraldine Brown) [3 months ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Great spot to enjoy some food, especially if you're staying at the hotel. We came in fairly late and had a very reasonably priced tasty meal.
Highly recommend the Jacob's ladder - it was fantastic. Steak sandwich was alright as well - the peppercorn sauce was the best part.
Service was a bit slow but they didn't seem to have many folks working on a Wednesday night, so I can understand that.
Dinner and dessert for 2 was under ‚Ç¨50 - very worth it. (by Kate Taylor) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 3 stars - The food was grand, not amazing. Got garlic prawns, chicken fajitas and salmon. Presentation was nice but the food wasn‚Äôt flavoursome. The dessert (eton mess) was very disappointing. Good menu and good potential but overall very average. (by Claire Organ) [3 years ago] | Review 7: 3 stars - Food was good. Not great. Service was slow. Sign at the door saying to remain there to be seated but was ignored for 5minutes, staff even looked at me but didn't bother to come over. Eventually seated after I walked towards a waitress.

The Birds and the Bees cocktail was fantastic, even the bees loved it [literally]! The Duck was phenomenal, hubs even tried the appetizer which surprised me! The steak was well cooked also.

(by Teresa) [a month ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - Decided to try on a busy Saturday night so atmosphere inside was good, service was quick and attentive.

Food was distinctly okay. Went for the steak but could not say it particularly stood out against other offerings elsewhere. Would give another try as rest of the menu has some good options. (by Jake Higgins) [5 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Great place for a date night, with areas for semi-private booths away from the open seating areas. The French onion soup was flavorful but a little sweet. Steaks were cooked perfectly, tender and juicy. Some bolder red wines (like a Primitivo) would pair better with good steaks. The cookie and ice cream is worth another visit. (by Mark Mirigian) [4 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Gorgeous steak - we shared the Tomahawk special (1kg). Dauphinaise potatos were a stand out - very cheesy! The blue cheese accompanying sauce was really lovely but the bone marrow butter was a little disappointing - tasted weirdly like shop bought garlic sauce?!
Tuna ceviche was missing a bit of the lime / citrus flavour I expected but was still enjoyable.

Baked Alaska and creme brulee were very tasty puddings. Wine list was decent.

Old fashioned cocktail was perfect!

Service was excellent and very attentive. (by Jemima Daisy) [2 weeks ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - We chose the set menu. Chicken liver parfait to start and then the ribeye steak, it's served with spinach and chips or mash. All delicious, my friend said it was the best steak he'd had in a long time. Service is also good, all in all definitely worth a visit whilst in Cork (by Elizabeth Sayers-Birdee) [3 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - We went here for our anniversary dinner, it was delicious we had a great experience. The cocktails were next level exquisite, i was driving and they accommodated my no alcohol request perfectly. All the cocktails are made to request as I was able to order any of the cocktails as mocktails. I ordered the pornstar martini and they even served me a shot of lemonade! My partner enjoyed normal cocktails and reported they were amazing. For dinner I ordered the sundries tomato cannelloni which wasn‚Äôt my favourite but still nice. My partner ordered the salmon which was cooked perfectly. We ordered a side of mashed potatoes which were creamy and delicious. Desert was equally delicious and the staff surprised us with a candle for our anniversary. Overall it was well worth the price. (by savannah flood) [4 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Absolutely fabulous! The food was very delicious and the portion sizes much bigger than I expected for reasonable prices.
Would definetly recommend if you are visiting Cork city. The vibe was also very nice and our server amazing!

Scoozi,Cork,"2/5 Winthrop Ave, Centre, Cork, Ireland",Family restaurant,4.5,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 5 stars - Writing this review is making me want to book a table all over again ‚Äî the food was outstanding!
The classic lasagne was honestly one of the most delicious I‚Äôve ever had in my life ‚Äî rich, hearty, and perfectly balanced.
My now-husband had the pasta, which was cooked to perfection. The sauce was a rich tomato with just the right kick of spice.
The pizza had that perfect crispy edge ‚Äî not too thick, not too thin.

But the star of the show? The Toblerone cheesecake.
As a huge cheesecake fan, I can honestly say I did not want to share. It was creamy, fluffy, and the buttery base crumbled beautifully under the fork.

A truly enjoyable experience ‚Äî the perfect fun date night.

üíë Fantastic company (by Amanda O' Sullivan) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - We ate at this place this evening. The manager who greeted us advised there was no table available (6pm Saturday evening) but if we were happy to wait 15 minutes we could be accommodated. We happily waited and were seated within 15 minutes.
The entire staff were amongst the most attentive I‚Äôve ever come across and appear genuinely happy to be there. The decor is very cosy and quaint. The food was spectacular. You can taste the quality and level of freshness of the ingredients. You really can see why this place won awards for the best food in cork in 2021 and again in 2025. You can see why people are willing to wait for this establishment. We even bumped into a local as we were lost the evening before nowhere near the place and he actually recommended this place. It was only once we were seated inside that I remembered this. Not just recommended by tourists but by locals as well. Just shows how well regarded this establishment is!!! Well done guys and keep up the good work! (by Jay Patel) [7 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - First time here and will defo be back! Got the chicken and chorizo pasta, really delicious. The main server at the front door and the lady who took our payment at the end were really friendly too.

Only one tiny complaint - the ‚Äúpassionfruit martini‚Äù on the menu was an orange üòÇ still delicious just maybe remove the word passionfruit from the name! (by Rachel C) [5 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - It‚Äôs my first time here and was so amazed of how the place was so chill and cozy. Staffs are very friendly, and the best of all was their food. It was perfect! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (by Mariz Gil Lagat) [3 months ago] | Review 5: 1 star - We came here looking for authentic Italian food and unfortunately left very disappointed.

When I asked if the pasta was fresh, our server didn‚Äôt even seem to know what fresh pasta was‚ÄîI had to explain it. We started with the Greek tartlet, but the base was raw at the bottom. The pizzas were no better: the dough wasn‚Äôt remotely close to authentic, and the Margherita came with a lot of balsamic drizzled on top, which was just strange.

We also ordered loaded fries and were told they were frozen‚Äîhonestly, they tasted it too. Overall, the food was poor quality, nowhere near Italian standards, and yet wildly overpriced for what‚Äôs being served.

This place feels over-rated and in no way represents proper Italian cooking. Hard pass from me. (by √Å Dal) [Edited 3 weeks ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Ordered the the Tagliatelle Carbonara.  It came with garlic bread. I really liked the sauce,  as it was smooth and butter wasn't separating. I would definitely recommend. (by Dave Wiebe) [a month ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - I went to Scoozi from the recommendation of my work colleague. I only had 30 min spare as I had to run for airport so I asked the waiter if its possible to fit me in for 30 min timing as I have to get my order and eat within 30 min to catch earlier ordered taxi for airport. The waiter was kind enough to recommend the amazing burger which was brought to me within 5 min and after eating it I even had some spare time left! Thank you so much for an awesome service. With given chance to come back to Cork I'll go deffinitelly back to try other delicious food üòä (by Adriana Sota) [2 months ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - Scoozi is a family favourite and for a reason.
It's a staple within the Cork food scene.
It serves Italian food with an Irish twist, it's simple yet tasty.
It's nice to see familiar faces within the place, their ma√Ætre d' has been around for a while.
He's always very friendly and welcoming.

Due to the demand, bookings are hard to come by and the queues can get very long.
Tried to use their booking system and emailed to confirm, but did not hear anything from the restaurant.
Better off ringing the restaurant to confirm/make bookings.
Prices are in line with inflation and prices around Cork.
Buffalo wings are covered in a tangy, sweet smokey sauce, very similar to BBQ sauce and were quite tough.
Their desserts have noticeably decreased in size.

Staff are really accommodating and were generally lovely to accommodate a family, especially with a toddler.
Overall, would never turn down a visit to Scoozi but it is harder to get in the door nowadays without a booking üòÖ. (by Gniddew Liame) [8 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - One of my favourite restaurants. Really busy, I would recommend to book if you are a walk in expect to wait 15-30 mins but it goes really fast. Service and food is exceptional and reasonably priced. I would recommend the lasagna the most! I look forward to coming back each time. (by Tara) [a year ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - My 2 aunts visited scoozis today for lunch, one of my aunts unfortunately collapsed, just before she did she also unfortunately had gotten very sick all over their sections. The staff jumped to my aunts aid and helped put her in the recovery position while my other aunt was extremely upset and worried to see her sister in such a state. A nurse happened to also be in the restaurant at the same time and also ran to my aunts aid. My family can not thank the staff enough for all the help,attention, compassion and care they showed my aunt today. A special mention has to be to a man working there named Rory. Rory stayed and sat with both my aunts reassuring them and minding them both till more family members arrived. Every single member of staff that was on shift today were absolute angels and again we can not thank them enough.

I had a really good cream of mushroom soup for appetizer, chicken breast stuffed with sausage tasty and tender and a flourless chocolate fudge cake that was delightful. They have a great selection of wines and spirits too. I really love it there. Highly recommended. (by Heriberto Rios) [6 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Food is delicious! I got the soup of the day, which happened to be a lovely carrot and turnip with cream. It had great consistency and the cream perfectly contrasted with the textured topping. The pan fried hake is always my go to, and it has never disappointed. Today, it was served with a tangy chickpea salad which paired beautifully with the milder and less overpowering flesh of the hake. Topped with a spinach and lime sauce, this was phenomenal.
For dessert, I recommend the affogato. The expresso with vanilla ice cream is a great way to freshen up, especially after a heavy meal.

Only lost points are for not offering tap water unless specifically requested. You will be charged an extra five euro for water otherwise, which seems a bit deceptive.

Nevertheless, staff are always very accommodating and friendly. The starter bread itself is also one of my favourites on its own and is baked on site.

Would definitely recommend!

Edit: raised my rating to 5 stars as Jacobs really does stand out from everywhere else I've dined at in the last weeks! (by PH) [Edited 9 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Beautiful space, loads of light through many skylights.
Excellent service, friendly and discreet.
There were 3 of us dining.
We opted for the early dinner 40 euro 3 courses.

Good options for most diners, I had the curry potatoes, the ragu with rigatoni, and finished with the Eton mess.
If we eat with our eyes, mine were very impressed.

The potato and leek soup was amazing, it came with homemade Guinness soda bread which was unreal.

The salmon was cooked beautifully and the ratatouille and potato wedges were flavorful. The steak sandwich plate was loaded with chips and a refreshing salad/coleslaw combo.

The only downside was they were playing dance/club music which didn‚Äôt quite fit with the atmosphere and was quite loud.

(by Coucou Ola) [11 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - I had the goatscheese burger and my friend the pasta with chicken and chorizo. Both were great. The burger had onion and cranberry sauce which complimented the goats cheese beautifully. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was a delight. The restaurant itself is welcoming and tends to be booked out (since eating there i know why) so I'd reserve a table if I was you. Definitely a must if you're in Cork!

Crawford & Co,Cork,"10/11 Anglesea St, Ballintemple, Cork, T12 CXN8, Ireland",Pub,4.2,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Best bar outside the city center, amazing little nooks to be left alone as well as large open areas for large party's or functions. Amazing bar food.
Id like to see some unusual Irish whiskey on the shelf to complement the already unusual mezcals and other cool bottles. Top marks. (by Paul Costello) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 2 stars - My group did brunch on a Sunday. Would not recommend it for a multitude of reasons.
Service was slow, most of our group did the bottomless. We had to ask to be topped up. Only after 45 minutes did we get an unprompted top-up. This pattern continued throughout, staff just disappeared for long periods.
Staff were nice and friendly though, it seemed more of a management issue.
The food was limited. Just chicken dishes, or a waffle dish. No eggs on a brunch menu?? Come on.
We had to repeatedly ask for basic things like ketchup, salt, water, etc.
The bar was a little run down, the table was dirty and the mens toilets stank badly.
At the end of the meal we were also overcharged, which they did refund when we poinged it out.
You'll get a better experience and more value elsewhere. (by Seamus Kearney) [a year ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - The best pub in Cork city . I was so lucky the manager Pat let me in when there was no one around to take the photos

If your visiting Cork this place is a must . It‚Äôs screaming of character everywhere. It‚Äôs got a wonderful feel to it if you want a bus then go to the pub if you want the garden outside of the lovely Zen feel you‚Äôve got that too.

They cater for hen and stag parties where you can have your own private area all to yourself .

It‚Äôs one of the nicest pubs I‚Äôve been in in a long time the food is fantastic the atmosphere is great super location right in the centre of Cork city .

All the staff got together in Covid and did the pub  up  and put their own personal touch and colour and positive happy joyful cheerful feel to the place .

I can‚Äôt wait to come back with some friends and show off this wonderful pub the best that Cork has to offer.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre eating inside or outside a lot of care and attention was put into  making you the customer feel special . (by Hetty IRL) [3 years ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Are you looking for an authentic Irish experience? Stop in here and feel the sense of community and connection.
The food is amazing. They serve wonderful coffee. And on different days they have different events.
There is also a cozy smoking area. (by Nate ON8 Productions) [Edited 6 years ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Lovely Brunch stop in Cork City centre, we went for the bottomless option which is very reasonable. They give you full glasses of prosecco and juice separately if you want to mix yourself, that's a good idea. The food was great and the staff are nice, they are very busy so as bottomless went my glass was empty a few times but that's probably on me and not them. They gave me an extra glass after the two hours to make up for it. I'd like to call again and try something else on the menu it was all very tasty. (by Dave Cullen) [3 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Been here a few times at this stage. Whether visiting for chips, dinner, pints, cocktails, spirits, the spirit of the venue itself, a match, some light music and a chat with friend(s) this place tends to deliver‚Ä¶ very rarely have I come away thinking I should have gone somewhere else. The staff are fierce professional and even allow some of their personality to shine through at times when serving tables. Yet to get to know anyone by name really but have ended up somewhat a regular overtime over the whole package on offer at this place.
With two separate menus for food entirely, depending on which entrance you enter into (but the same group of staff managing both), you‚Äôre sure to find something you like whether you‚Äôre in for quick bite, a drink and a small bite, a full dinner or a coffee/tea and a bit of sport in a television / to listen to some light music.
Atmosphere is obvious upon entering this place too and the staff do their best! From my experience they are very sweet, humble and attentive where possible too while doing what they can to treat every table equally ‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt expect more than this at all, any more is completely brownie points üòé (by Sam Fitzgibbon) [3 years ago] | Review 7: 3 stars - The food is good, location and vibe is nice. The only issue I have with the place is that it is clearly understaffed, which means it takes forever for you to even order, and then the order arrives late. They almost always forget to get napkins and condiments. (by M.) [2 years ago] | Review 8: 2 stars - Went for bottomless brunch. I will give credit that the drinks actually felt bottomless even with it being quite busy however, the chicken and waffles I got was a pretty small portion and the chicken was dry and just felt like it was in the freezer for a long time and the waffle was so dry it would get caught in my throat. In the past the food here used to be exceptional. Really disappointed that the quality has really gone downhill (by Leonidas Savva) [8 months ago] | Review 9: 4 stars - This bar has been transformed in the last few months.  It was originally The Market Tavern. Bar makeovers are difficult; this one, however,  has been completely successful.  It has been so successful that this bar is as good as anything you'll find city centre without the hassle of going city centre queuing and the like.  It incorporates a central entrance that also functions as a cafe. The coffee is excellent and this is matched by high quality pub food. The lighting and layout are well thought out and late night entertainment is also on a par with anything you'll get city centre. Hardly surprising that the Beamish on tap was spectacularly good and I'd highly recommend it.

- Rustic Potatoes are the safe choice, good quantity and just fine in term of taste !

They didn't have the pizza last time I was here so I was excited to try it. I love a thin base so it was right up my alley. Highly recommend the Dali. (by Anna Collins) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Attended this venue with a large group of friends. The venue was warm and welcoming. Had a large selection of seat available for all to sit comfortably.
There is a pizza oven outside where you can order a pizza to accompany your drinks. However, if you are seated outside be aware of the possibility of soot falling as it may ruin your clothing.
All in all great venue with a great atmosphere!! (by DC reviews) [a month ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Tom Barry's is a brilliant traditional type pub on the South side of Cork with the perfect mix of both indoor and outdoor spaces.
The staff are super friendly and they encourage a great atmosphere with trad music and chats, its always a great night here!
They serve a beautiful pint of the Guinness as well as other popular local and not so local beers to carter to everyone!

27-July-2025 Update:
My wife and I called in as we were nearby and said its been a minute since we were here.
The bar hasn't changed much if at all and the staff as as friendly as ever!
I got one of the local Cork beers Original 7 Larger and my wife got a Murphy's stout and we took in the fine weather out the back in the beer garden.

Food:
The pizzas here are delicious! I highly recommend stopping by for a pizza and mach use of the pizza and a pint deal!
We got a spicey salami pizza and a garlic and tomato sauce pizza while we were here. Both were amazing and we were surprised by the garlic pizza as we didn't realise it didn't have cheese but it was perfectly delicious!

Old Review:
There is loads of space to choose from be it the small bar at the front, the back room by the fire, the side bar by the beer garden and last but not least, the fantastic beer garden out the back! Any area you choose will be great!
It can be very busy at weekends but come here early or mid week if you are looking for something a little quieter!
Over the years I've spent many a Friday or Saturday evening catching up with friends and its always been a great location!
The beer garden is my favourite spot in this bar and they have their own pizza kitchen in the back garden as well.
Definitely check out Tom Barry's, you won't be disappointed! (by Thomas Thornton) [Edited 2 months ago] | Review 4: 2 stars - Had the Frida pizza and was very underwhelmed to be honest. Was falling all apart and toppings not dough weren't good enough.

Always great staff, friendly fun and easygoing.  Lots of choice for drinks and lovely pizza made to order. Beer garden is lovely with a cover when needed. I dont think for me Tom Barrys ever dissapoints except for the fact it no longer has Tom. It really is a south side gem in my eyes. (by Joce Coughlan) [a month ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - If you‚Äôre in Cork, you must not miss Tom Barry‚Äôs for it‚Äôs one of the amazing pizza places in town!
Situated just a few steps away from the centre, it‚Äôs one of the oldest pubs and beer gardens that serves super authentic Italian pizzas.
The outdoor seating area is ideal for summers.
The food is super delicious and their perfect thin crust pizzas have an amazing texture.
Our personal favourite pizza is FRIDA with its mixture of ham, cherry tomatoes, mozzarella and rockets.

PS: Do check their meal deals and offers to save some bucks. (by Jaee Sakhalkar) [3 years ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - A pleasant surprise! Amazing food and vibrant atmosphere. The pizza and the Italian dish were perfect! Great service! Thank you!!! (by Pablo Morais) [8 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Amazing Italian pizza by an Italian pizza boy! Tasty. His pizza can hardly be compared to other (non Italian) places in Cork for its savorous flavors and garnish.
Along with birra moretti my pizza Caravaggio is worth a short detour away from city center.

It was fully booked apart from two seats at the bar which we took

The place is small, but the atmosphere is buzzing helped by the open fire pit where the chefs cook the meat

The micro brewery makes excellent beers, especially nice pale ales both of which I tried

We had smoked beetroot with whipped wasabi cheese and pork belly with a spicy caramel glaze for starters followed by 2 beautifully cooked rib eye steaks along with the deep fried mushrooms

The food was terrific, the service great and we finished off with two cocktails instead of dessert

Not cheap, but well worth it (by Mark Purchase) [4 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Okay, I can see what the rave reviews are about. I'm always a little skeptical when somewhere is rated THIS highly, but they have matched it.

The aroma as you walk in starts everything off right, and while the menu is limited, it is limited to what they do best. The service was excellent and attentive and everything fit nicely into the experience.

Paradiso,Cork,,,4.8,,,,,"Review 1: None - A tasting menu of six courses was superb, reminiscent of the Michelin-rated Anglo, formerly in Farringdon. Every course was felicitous, well-judged, full of various flavours and beautifully presented. The courses were served at the right pace and every one of the em was a pleasure. We were comfortably full by the end, and very impressed with the chef‚Äôs ingenuity. (by Giles Bird) | Review 2: None - What a place‚Ä¶ only in Cork for two nights and we visited Paradiso tonight‚Ä¶ we were blown away by the food, service and ambiance. The restaurant has the perfect balance of being fine dining, but still relaxed and not at all pretentious. We had six courses and they were all incredible‚Ä¶ would happily come back to Cork just to eat here again. I‚Äôm not vegetarian but would rate the food here higher than 99% of restaurants that do serve meat. Would highly recommend for vegetarians and carnivores alike. (by Thurston King) | Review 3: None - Cork long standing and outstanding Vegetarian restaurant, met sister and friends who are regulars for first visit, the ambience and dining room is intimate and warm, the welcome and service from the team is incredible, the sommelier guides you through a very well curated and delightful choice of wines with tough choices to be made with helpful and insightful suggestions and then of course the food, beautifully fresh and seasonal ingredients combined and cooked perfectly and paired with fantastic sauces that demand to be eaten and mopped up with the light and tasty bread provided, the set menu has a wonderful array of textures, hero vegetables and presentation is first class. I would definitely recommend the whole experience, food, wine and wonderful service Dave and the team provide for all customers, great job and thanks Team Paradiso üòÉ (by Darragh Miller) | Review 4: None - I can't rave enough about our culinary experience at Paradiso in Cork! This restaurant not only exceeded our expectations but delivered a true masterpiece of creativity and finesse. From the moment we stepped inside, the unique atmosphere enveloped us: warm, welcoming, yet modern and stylish. The service was simply flawless ‚Äì incredibly attentive, friendly, and passionate about what they do, which was evident in every detail.

The food was absolutely incredible. We had the pleasure of enjoying the vegan and gluten-free tasting menu with wine pairing ‚Äì and what a discovery it was! In Ireland, it's not often you find a restaurant that delivers on these requirements with such creativity and finesse. Every dish was a true work of art ‚Äì fresh ingredients, harmonious flavors, and surprising combinations that never ventured into the realm of ‚Äúordinary‚Äù or ‚Äúrun-of-the-mill.‚Äù

The aperitif that welcomed us was the perfect introduction to what was to come: sparkling, refreshing, and beautifully balanced. The first course of the menu was a creative interpretation of local seasonal ingredients, prepared with such attention to detail. It was a true taste experience! What really stood out was how each dish was not only vegan and gluten-free, but also didn‚Äôt compromise on flavor or texture in any way.

Another highlight was the wine pairing, which was perfectly matched to each course. The wines we were served were exceptional, and they complemented the food‚Äôs flavors in a stunning way. The sommelier truly knew his craft!

But what really made this experience special wasn‚Äôt just the fantastic food ‚Äì it was the heartwarming atmosphere and the exceptional staff. You immediately feel welcomed, like you‚Äôre part of the Paradiso family. The passion and dedication of the team to great food and excellent service is truly infectious.

In Cork, it‚Äôs rare to find a restaurant that offers such high-quality vegan and gluten-free options in this level of creativity and excellence. It‚Äôs clear that Paradiso goes far beyond the typical restaurant experience ‚Äì it‚Äôs a place where food becomes a true experience.

Absolutely recommended! This restaurant will definitely become one of our favorite spots in Ireland. If you dine here, you can be sure you‚Äôll have an extraordinary time ‚Äì both gastronomically and in terms of service and ambiance.

Final Thoughts: If you‚Äôre in Cork, don‚Äôt miss Paradiso ‚Äì a true gem of Irish gastronomy! (by Mario) | Review 5: None - Absolutely exquisite dining experience.
Savoured every last bit of every single plate!
Thank you chefs and staff for wonderful evening (by Elina Zerne-Oshea) | Review 6: None - If you'd told me the best vegan dining experience I'd ever experience would be in Cork I'd not have believed it. So glad we took the time, I was blown away. I'll be thinking about this meal forever. (by Aisling Wood) | Review 7: None - We had the most wonderful dining experience at Paradiso, an elegant and beautifully curated vegetarian restaurant. What made our evening truly special was the outstanding service.

Laura was warm, attentive, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu.

The courses arrived at just the right pace, and she made us feel genuinely welcome throughout the meal.

It‚Äôs rare to find service that is both professional and personal, and Laura struck that balance perfectly. She truly elevated our experience.

Little pricy but a really memorable experience in Cork, Ireland (by Atul Thakrar) | Review 9: None - My husband and I have been vegan for 8 years, and I can confidently say this has been the best vegan dining experience we‚Äôve ever had! From the service to the INCREDIBLE food, everything was top quality. I‚Äôd also highly recommend the wine paring as well, delicious! (by Michelle Camarata) | Review 10: None - Recently dined at Paradiso, expecting a delightful fine-dining experience. Visited it again after two years, expecting the same excellent experience as before. Back then, the set menu was different, and every single course was exceptional. This time, it was the complete opposite. The food lacked flavor and finesse. Nothing stood out. Hoping this was just a one-off, because the drop in quality and taste and was shocking. Not to miss dint really stand for the price also.

No.76,Cork,"76 S Mall, Centre, Cork, Ireland",Bar,4.3,,,,,"Review 1: 3 stars - After seeing the menu online we were a bit let down by the choice on the day. From a selection of eight mains there were two burgers and two steaks, it was a bit less of the creative choices we‚Äôd seen on older menus. The quality is decent, and the service is friendly - but just a bit disorganised. We had staff queuing up to bring drinks and take our order but then didn‚Äôt see anyone again until well after we were finished the mains. We asked for dessert menus but then I guess the waiter finished their shift, which is fine, but nobody else came anywhere near us for about half an hour. (by Michael Devery) [3 years ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - How does this have so little reviews. This is sooo high quality. Hottest peppercorn sauce in the land. Very nice halloumi and lobster& prawn ravioli. Never had it before but really enjoyed it. Worth what I paid for sure. Same with the sirloin well done. Very nice overall. Both dishes cleaned.

Our server was very kind and funny as well. Forgot to get his name. Mexican chap. Very nice and after it took a while to get my drink he was so apologetic about it bless him.

The desert was beyond amazing for me. Honestly one of my favourite deserts of the year . Ferrero rocher choux. Just phenomenal. And the crumble was nice as well. But damn that ferrero is 10/10! Ended up at 110 all in all for 2 mains, 2 deserts, 2 cocktails and a pint of Heineken. In a high class city hotel restaurant that‚Äôs very doable for the lovely service. And really chill atmosphere.

Just annoyed at what I was wearing haha. Wasn‚Äôt expecting to dine in here. Again very nice job altogether. Especially nice for those tourists of you coming for a weekend staying in the city. No doubt you‚Äôll have a great eat. And music at half 9. (by Photography by Liam Anderson) [3 years ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Really fab wine Guinness and cocktails. Great loos.

He also gave us some great recommendations for things to do. Overall was a delightful experience! (by Nidhi Patel) [3 years ago] | Review 9: 4 stars - Always loved the ambience here but in later times I think they take the p*ss a bit with drinks prices.. Not a place you'd make your 'local' really either as the clientelle is quite particular.
Having said that they keep it well, it's always inviting and comfortable and location is superb.
Main bar doesn't do coffees which seems unusual to me and on one occasion they wouldn't let us source any from Lafyettes caf√© in the same hotelüßê
No.76 is often attracts older customers, especially during the week. (by Yvonne Madden) [a year ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Had dinner reservations, they gave us no menus, never took a drink order, or set our table, or gave us water etc.  When we got menus (after having to flag down a manager who was put out that she had to do an ounce of work), we then couldn't get anyone to take our order.  Plenty of staff there, just not making any effort to do anything.  The 2 managers stood on the stairs all night looking at a match.  Asked someone to take our order,  he said I can take your food order but you have to go to the bar and order drinks yourself.  I have never in my life heard of anywhere where you can't get drinks with your food! You couldn't get served at the bar then, nobody would even make eye contact.   At the end, they couldn't figure out how to get our bill, after 10-12 mins, they gave  it to me and there was prosecco on there.  I was like, eh, i couldn't even order a drink,  how is there prosecco on here?! Absolute joke of a place. Run by muppets.  Actually cancelled a night we had booked to stay for the jazz weekend and meet friends in the bar... if they can't handle a Saturday night, then they definitely couldn't handle the jazz weekend!

Proper ratios of authentic, delicate flavors using tasty ingredients that taste the part as much as they look it (unlike so many other shops with notions). Grab your food and go around the corner to eat at the free Elizabeth Fort's picnic tables, instead. I suppose if I'd ding anything it would be the very un-Japanese demeanor of kitchen staff, but what can you do, this isn't Japan lol. Also, wish there was a more environmentally friendly option for this kind of takeaway.

(by ≈†imon V√©gh) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Came here together with my friend and partner and we ordered three different dishes.

I ordered the January special (Kimchi Porkbelly Ricebowl with natto and soft boiled egg). It was a very generous portion size and super tasty. I personally LOVE natto, that‚Äôs why I wished there was a bit more natto. I think it was just a teaspoon or less (but maybe it‚Äôs because Irish people are not used to the taste).

My partner ordered a Karaage Don which was our personal highlight! So so good. Super crunchy and juicy and the spices were just perfect.

My Japanese friend ordered Udon and paid extra for Natto and unfortunately this is the only dish we cannot recommend. The portion size was surprisingly quite small for the price and also the noodles texture was not great. Also, she paid 2‚Ç¨ extra for natto (on request) but got only a small teaspoon on top of her bowl. That was a little bit disappointing.
The soup base was very delicious, though.

Overall I still rate this place with five stars with the hope that there will be some changes for the Udon dish and to highlight their great rice bowls!
Will definitely come back again next time when I‚Äôm in cork :) (by Ajumi H) [8 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Phenomenal food! Probably the best Katsu Curry I've ever had (by Aaron Dougherty) [2 months ago] | Review 9: 3 stars - Is it worth the hype?

The Ten Don which the sauce should be served separately from the dish, instead of doing this, they poured the sauce in the dish and it makes everything SOGGY. I think it ruined the Ten Don.

The ramen tasted bad‚Ä¶ feels like ordering a ‚Ç¨17.6 instant noodles, DO NOT ODER this. (by YJ H) [5 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Really rich and authentic food! Worth a try for sure.

Whenever I have friends going to Cork, will recommend this place to them! (by Alden Salgado) [3 months ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - Really nice experience at this restaurant. The  menu was really appealing and ours starters and mains delicious! My only complaint would be the desert. I ordered the brownie which looked amazing on all the pictures I had seen and had very good reviews.. but unfortunately it was served cold (very slightly heated up in a microwave), with hard crusts.. and the drizzle of ‚Äúsalted caramel‚Äùwas completely artificial and tasted very very sweet. But other than that we had a very good evening. (by Estere B) [5 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - A lovely and well-kept place, right in the heart of Cork on Oliver Plunkett Street.
The staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming. The food is truly authentic Irish cuisine, with outstanding quality.

I highly recommend the onion soup, topped with a traditional cheese from County Cork ‚Äì pure comfort food!
The homemade desserts are excellent, and there‚Äôs a great selection of craft beers.
As expected in Ireland, tap water is served for free.

What can I say? A great experience ‚Äì highly recommended! (by Pasquale Cerone) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - Market Lane was by our hotel and the menu looked good, so we decided to check it out one night for dinner. It was a Tuesday, just after 7 and it was packed inside. Luckily, there was an outside table for the three of us, and they were able to accommodate a stroller.

For drinks, I was looking forward to a Guinness, but they didn't have. So instead, I had the Angel stout, which was very smooth. It was a bit darker and a little more bitter than Guinness, but still good. For food, we had:

-Chicken liver p√¢t√©, spiced plum chutney with sourdough toast - not sure if I really loved this one but the sourdough toast was good
Glenbeigh mussels steamed in white wine, cream, celery and herbs with crusty baguette  - I don't normally like anything with celery but I didn't taste it here, so it was fine. I liked the mussels. This kind was small, which I prefer to the giant ones found in the U.S.
-Pan roast Ballycotton monkfish, garlic ratte potatoes, roast pepper pur√©e, lemon salted green beans, smoked pancetta and almond crumb - the fish was cooked perfectly and tasted fresh, but the green beans could have used a bit more cooking time
-Sirloin Steak (10oz) - my husband got this one since he wanted to try the beef in Ireland, and it didn't disappoint. Their steaks are served with mushrooms, house chips, shallots and choice of: peppercorn and brandy cream, whipped garlic butter or roasted pepper chimichurri. He picked the peppercorn and brandy, which was nice

I really liked that they had a kids' menu and that there were no chicken tenders or pizza to be found on there. Instead, there were dishes like shepherd's pie, pasta Bolognese, and roasted chicken breast. They even had a baby bowl, which we ended up ordering for my 8-month old. It was a huge bowl of mashed potatoes, finely shredded chicken, with tiny bits of soft carrots. She loved it! It also came with a side of gravy, but we used that for ourselves. It tasted similar to the peppercorn and brandy cream that came with the steak. I really appreciated this menu item because I never really see baby food on restaurant menus, and this allowed her to be a part of our dining experience.

Cocktails: were great, tasted very good. We had mango loco and bohemian raspberry.

Starters: calamari and the duck. Calamari was simply amazing, the duck was tasty but portion was kinda lacking. Crispy skin would have been a plus.

Mains: we had the fish curry (not in the menu) and monkfish. All flavours were amazing and perfect. Mains took about 40 min to arrive. House was packed but still, someone should have followed up and told us it was delayed

Desserts: creme brule and the lemon ""tiramisu"". Creme brule was divine and super tasty. The tiramisu should not be called a tiramisu. It's a lemon dessert with lady fingers inside. All it tasted was the lemon and nothing else. The lemon over powers all other tastes and makes it underwhelming.

Woolshed Baa & Grill - Cork,Cork,"Mardyke Entertainment Complex, The, Sheares St, Cork, T12 CX7A, Ireland",Sports bar,4.3,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Visited the Wool Shed Bar and Grill and they have a nice menu I went with the Chips and Pulled Pork simply because it was the only meal on the menu that came with chips.

It is definitely very popular for the price of ‚Ç¨9.90 as I seen staff going back and forth to different tables with this meal. I would of going with the Chicken for ‚Ç¨18 euros but for such a pricey chicken it do not come with a few chips. If chips was added to that menu item and other menu items they would definitely sell a lot more from the menu.

The pulled pork and chips were very tasty and filling definitely worth the price. Cooked well. The service from the staff was excellent checking to see if all was ok. The girl that took the order was very nice and very helpful with explaining the menu.

The Mardyke Entertainment Venue is very large as it has a large snooker and pool section. It has bowling lanes and there is an open air rooftop area. Downstairs more seating for large groups for food and dinning.

Also another small bar with arcade games called the Barcadia. The main downstairs pub has  plenty of screens with lots of choices to watch different sports. This entertainment venue has it all.

Great staff great service and great food.

Would just add that if the meals came with chips as standard the meals would definitely be value for money and add more variety and would sell more.

Wings were lovely and the pint was a pint. üëç
It should be noted that this whole venue is 21+ ALL DAY on Saturday (also Friday I believe) but they make exceptions to families. We saw two 18 year old lads with IDs get turned away at around 2pm, while there were actual toddlers wandering around inside. Odd rule so plan ahead! Nice if you're older as it's a less messy atmosphere than some of the 18+ bars in the city on the weekend. (by Lily Rose) [Edited a year ago] | Review 6: 1 star - This place is a disgrace
Almost ‚Ç¨7.00 for a pint of Murphys
And ‚Ç¨20.00 an hour for pool.
The seating here is appalling

I'll never go back to this establishment again (by Desmond Jordan) [Edited a month ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - We went there for dinner while bowling. Food is very nice and portions are large.

Definitely would come back (by Martyna Ahern) [8 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Can't say anything better about the kitchen manager. We had a mix up on the food and not only did she handle everything and convince me to give it a second chance, she treated me as a brother. She made sure I was content and then some. Wonderful management. And extremely great customer service. Pay your kitchen manager all you can because she's worth her weight in gold. (by Brandon) [5 years ago] | Review 9: 1 star - I went into the woolshed with my pals, and the man at the entrance allowed us and did not ask us for ID or anything if we were going in, and he let us in because we were all over the age of 18 and simply followed the rules. So we proceeded to the bar, had a drink, looked for a table and eventually ordered meals. After a few minutes, the waiter appears out of nowhere to request our ID. Two of my friends forgot to bring it, but they had it on their phones. We were halfway through our drinks when one of the security ladies told us to leave since we didn't have ID. How is this fair? Are they being racist? They literally told us to get out! It‚Äôs their fault if that was the case they should have not allowed us to get in at the first place. Worst experience. Never been treated like this before. They cancelled our food order and we had to sip our drinks so quickly cause we paid for it already.

The food was overall really really nice. The Caesar Salad was a whole chicken snitchel and some lettuce. We had to ask for more lettuce and we‚Äôre not usually the kind of people to do that. Eggs Benedict was amazing, as was the Buddha Bowl, though ‚Ç¨4 extra for chicken seems a bit much. French Toast was great, no issues.
Biggest issue is that there didn‚Äôt seem to be enough staff but that is understandable at the moment.

Since we couldn't reserve one, we booked a table inside. When we arrived, we noticed many empty tables outside and asked if we could move, as it was a beautiful sunny day. Unfortunately, we were told that since we had already booked an indoor table, we couldn't switch to an outdoor one, even though several were available ( in and out side) (by Kate Smile) [a year ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Great service and location!

The staff were amazing and made the evening extra special by bringing out the cheesecake with a candle and singing happy birthday. It was so kind of them to take the cheesecake off the bill.

(by Gabbie J) [4 months ago] | Review 3: 1 star - Despite Luigi Malones‚Äô generally positive reviews, my experience tonight was nothing short of terrible. I ordered the cheeseburger with bacon, and it was honestly the worst burger I‚Äôve ever had. It was clearly, unmistakably frozen‚Äîlike something you‚Äôd find for 50 cent in Aldi‚Äôs freezer. I eat half of it out of pure hunger before getting sick in the bathroom. It‚Äôs obvious this place has gone drastically downhill and is now serving up low-grade, frozen food while cutting corners at every opportunity. See the attached photo of the ‚Äúburger meat.‚Äù (by Harvey Johnson) [4 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - I was skeptical going here but all my friends love it so I gave it a go
The reason I was so skeptical is because I'm a vegetarian and Italian places usually don't have many *good* options for me
I was pleasantly surprised to see tofu and chickpea fajitas on the menu and I was excited but a lil hesitant
But
They were AMAZING!!! I mean, these fajitas are 10 times better than the veggie fajitas I've gotten in Mexican places in Cork
And my passion fruit cocktail was lovely too (by AJ Nagle) [4 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - It is the best option in the city. Delicious meal, warming space with nice light and decoration and the best service that I have ever seen in a restaurant.

(by Nikitha Nair) [Edited 3 weeks ago] | Review 7: 3 stars - Very busy at dinner hour.  Although space was available.  After being seated it seemed like 15 minutes before we were contacted by our server.  She was less than joyful.  We saw her about another 15 minutes later to order.  Food took a while to arrive also.  It appeared that other servers were more attentive.  The food that arrived was OK, not spectacular.  Upon finishing our meal we sat waiting for our server to either check on us or bring the bill.  She was busy cleaning tables, sweeping and didn't avert her attention towards us, as I was waiting to hail her.  We walked up to the cashier and paid the bill.  Everything was less than what we expected for this dining experience.

Service was excellent, too. We showed up close to closing time, but the staff were really friendly and didn‚Äôt rush us at all. It felt welcoming and relaxed the whole time we were there.

(by Alex ‚Äúthekyz‚Äù Garcia) [5 months ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - We loved to go to Dashi and it was our go-to takeaway in COVID times. I ordered for collection on a Thursday evening at 7pm, half of the sushi options were gone and the curry and udon noodle dishes (or at least parts thereof) were heated in a microwave, and it still took them 25 minutes to put the order together. The dishes lacked veggies and where mediocre at best, and I couldn't finish the seaweed salad. Very disappointed.

Lovely staff members! (by Viktoriia) [6 months ago] | Review 9: 1 star - I am not usually the type to leave a bad review online, however I think in this circumstance it is warranted, and will serve as a warning to future customers!
First and foremost, I have been to Dashi Sushi on a few other occasions and I think it is fair to say that the staff are not the friendliest/boarding on rude. So with that said, I never have high hopes regarding the service but overall I have enjoyed the food.

This evening I was really looking forward to treating myself to some sushi as I had some child free time. Upon entering I placed my order and as I was waiting to ask the staff member for a straw, I took a short video of the sushi on the display counter to send to my friend. There was no member of staff near me or even in the direction I was filming. As I was still waiting for service I could see the two women talking and frowning to one another until eventually the owner came to me and asked me why I was recording in her restaurant. I was honestly in such shock and taken back by the tone at which she approached me. I told her I took a short video of the sushi to send to my friend, which she again asked why, and replied that it was a strange thing to do! Implying I some kind of nefarious motives for doing so which was absolutely not the case. She also implied I had recorded her staff member and I have no idea why they thought this- or why I would want to do this? Obviously this video was taken as I liked the display! She said ‚Äòdid you not see the sign on our door‚Äô to which I said no, clearly I did not. I looked for a sign as I left but didn‚Äôt see one then either so maybe make a bigger sign of it‚Äôs this much of an issue? To go out of your way to embarrass and argue with someone when it‚Äôs pretty clear they are not doing anything malicious is pretty crazy and a sure way to lose customers. She went on asking why I did this once again highlighting how it was strange behaviour on my part! Clearly trying to embarrass me and continue an argument. I was speechless because in this day and age- is it really strange to take photos or videos in a restaurant? They even have a whole section of their own instagram dedicated to customers photos/videos. I also sent them the recording I took to prove that nobody was in it. She then told me I was getting defensive- and when I tried to diffuse the situation by saying I think it was a misunderstanding and that she got the wrong end of the stick- she snapped back at me. You really couldn‚Äôt make it up. There were so many better ways she could of approached this situation but unfortunately she choose a bad one, hence my negative review.  If she had kindly told me they didn‚Äôt like videos being taken on the premises that is no problem- instead she chose to accuse me of videoing a staff member with zero proof, keep prying at me and insinuate what I did was weird when it was not.

I was so mortified as all the other customers overheard the whole thing and were clearly made feel uncomfortable also. I sat down to wait for my food as I didn‚Äôt want it to ruin my evening, however the atmosphere was noticeably bad and I was made to feel very unwelcome for the duration of my meal. I would say this is the strange behaviour- not mine.

I can confirm I will not be back and will be telling others to avoid.

Also the prices in front of the restaurant are not exact, it is not right to not put a menu up to date in front of your facility (the price difference was very big for instance 11 to 17‚Ç¨  actually)

(by Nini) [Edited a year ago] | Review 10: 3 stars - Not an authentic Chinese restaurant, but the food was ok(not the best, but good). I have found that the service, although nice and attentive, was slow (it took 40 minutes just to have starters). Might be worth to come back again to review my comment on this restaurant.

Son of a Bun,Cork,"29 MacCurtain Street, Victorian Quarter, Cork, T23 NX05, Ireland",Hamburger restaurant,4.6,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 5 stars - We ate here one Friday evening after a 40 minute wait for a table. The place was extremely busy but the service was still reasonably quick. The food was really good. Our only issue was that we ordered too much of it (mac & cheese is quite heavy as a side dish). Thankfully the staff were able to package some of my wife's unfinished salad to take away. (by Daniel Farrelly) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - We came here for a family meal recently, there was 4 adults and 3 kids. We all ordered burgers and sides, followed by desserts. The food is absolutely delicious here and the staff are so friendly. There's a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The only downside is having to wait for a table but I guess it's because the place is so popular and rightly so... So having said that, it is definitely worth the wait, and hopefully we'll get back there soon! (by Trish Lambert) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - I am currently here from the States for work. I waited 30 minutes until they opened up. It was well worth the wait! I got The One (no mayo and with cheddar instead of American)with the fries with skin on them which the  recommended. Both the burger and fries were so good! Waiter was cordial and good atmosphere. I highly recommend Son of a Bun. Can‚Äôt wait until my next visit. (by Francisco Zeno Jr) [3 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Really good burgers that are huge!

The kimchi one was spicy and tasty, the taco one with fried peppers was perfectly seasoned, the S.O.B was generous and good and the waffle one was very good with the sugary salty flavors. For the sides, the Mac and cheese was very good and the fries crispy. The only thing I'd have to say is that it's very loud inside. (by Chlo√© Morineau) [2 weeks ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Best meal I've had in all of Ireland so far! Though I would definitely not consider it traditional Irish food of course, lol.

Exactly what I was looking for fir my last nights stay. The ribs I highly recommend.

There is some outdoor seating that is covered (a rarity in Ireland). The food was alright, but left a little something to be desired. Service was pleasant. I would return, but probably more for drinks than for food. The music was a good volume and again, enjoyed the atmosphere. (by Kevin McCabe) [a year ago] | Review 3: 3 stars - Atmosphere really nice and staff were lovely. Food came out super quick too, despite being busy. Got the platter for 2 (‚Ç¨40). The wings and chips were delicious. The mini burgers and sausages were nice too. Personally didn‚Äôt like the steak as I prefer it more well done but that‚Äôs personal preference. Unfortunately the stuffed spuds were stone cold which was disappointing. Cocktails 5/5, got a tropical dacquiri which was delicious

01/06/2024- went for bottomless brunch. Thought it was the list of drinks on the menu- mimosas, Bellini, Bloody Mary but it was only Prosecco which was disappointing‚Ä¶. The French toast was nice and pancakes nice but super filling (by Rachel C) [Edited a year ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - The food was decent. Got the blue cheese burger which felt quite fatty but considering the toppings it should have been expected.

Prices are worth it. Can't wait to go back. (by Rees) [a month ago] | Review 7: 2 stars - The staff were lovely. It‚Äôs in a nice area of the city, but can‚Äôt recommend this place. The food was very bad.

Older Irish people will remember Dunnes stores years ago did an unbranded cellophane wrapped pizza with slidey tomato and cheese fused together, so if you bit it too late you could pull it all off the pizza without touching the base. The pizza here was like that: had the same rubbery cheese and base texture. The pepperoni was tasteless and curled up, like from a pack at tescos. This pizza was ‚Ç¨16.

My partner and her friend got stuff that was ‚Ç¨9+ which was also pretty tasteless and not at all what was expected.

Again, the staff were really friendly - but there are so many places within five minutes or less walk which serve similar food at similar prices, and are way way better. (by Sean Power) [a month ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - Very good brunch!
The poached eggs were really good.
Nicely decorated, great atmosphere, nice terrace out front, friendly staff and great food selection (also gluten free option available). (by Assunta D) [7 years ago] | Review 9: 4 stars - We were waiting a really long time on the cocktails, although the place was nearly empty. They were lovely, though, every single one.

Bella Napoli,Cork,"20 Academy St, Centre, Cork, T12 V9DK, Ireland",Italian restaurant,4.5,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 5 stars - Teh food is phenomenal. We had a cheese plate as an appetizer and lasagna / the house salad as a main. Food tastes home cooked by your Italian nonna. Everything was fresh and extremely well made. Staff was super nice and looked after us well. Because of the size of the restaurant and 3 areas (smoking outside, non smoking outside and inside) there can be small wait times. All in all I definitely recommend you to dine here. It's so very worth it! (by Steph anie) [a month ago] | Review 2: 3 stars - Excellent food, BUT... waited 10/15 for waitress to take out order, just about finished our starter and we got our mains served,  then as we were finishing, we were told we had 10 minutes left at the table and were asked to finish.  This was never mentioned to us when we sat down, that we had a limited time. No option to get dessert, we asked could we at least sit outside and finish our wine, so we did.
Despite this, the food was really good, just a pity we were rushed so much and no dessert. (by Eibhlin Cahalane McGibney) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Excellent food. I wanted to try everything on the menu. Scallops are not to be missed. And the blood orange soda is really good. I wish we had room for dessert! (by Jessica Ellem) [a month ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Very nice staff and the food was very good quality. Both me and my wife enjoyed our food and would go back.

(by Robert Varnado) [3 months ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Nice cozy restaurant in the center of Cork. We loved pizza and there is some ok selection of wine you can choose from. Reasonably priced.

The restaurant is quite compact but they gave us table that is enough for 6 people.

We also liked starters with prawns and scallops. The portion is also pretty big so we were full.

It was quite busy so we had to wait for the food for a while. (by Seongkoo Lee) [3 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Lovely food. Both Beef croquettes and prawns very nice.

Ragu napoletano and braised short rib beef. Cant fault. Was delicious

Restaurant is reasonably priced and we could walk in‚Äôs mid week with no booking at all.
Will be back here again. (by Dazz Phelan) [4 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - This is the best gluten free pasta dish I think I've had to date. It's hard to find coeliac accommodating restaurants in the city that are also appetising, especially pasta dishes. The service was fast and friendly and the dishes are very reasonably priced with good portion sizes. I would highly recommend! (by laura keeley) [4 months ago] | Review 9: 4 stars - I got the ragu alla genovese. They have a gluten free option, which is great as a coeliac. However, for the price of ‚Ç¨21.50 I did not find the portion to be very generous. Additionally, the ratio of meat to pasta was off in my opinion, with too much beef in the dish. However, the meal was tasty, the service was efficient and friendly, and there was a lovely atmosphere in the restaurant. (by Clodagh Gaffney) [3 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - We‚Äôve always loved Bella Napoli, but this was our first time dining there for dinner, and I‚Äôm so glad I made a reservation‚Äîit was packed! It's easy to see why, though‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre the best Italian restaurant in town. The pasta is always perfectly cooked, and the sauces are rich and flavourful. Our waiter was attentive and helpful, especially when three of us wanted the Ragu Napoletano. He suggested one of us try the Ragu alla Genovese for some variety, and it turned out to be an incredible choice. My friend absolutely loved it! I‚Äôm def going back to try this one myself.

The only small disappointment was that I mentioned in the reservation that we were celebrating my mother‚Äôs birthday. Coming from the service industry, I know even a quick ""Happy Birthday"" can make a guest feel special, and I think my mom would have really appreciated the gesture. I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre obligated to do anything extra, but a small acknowledgment would have added a nice personal touch.

We didn‚Äôt stay for dessert since we were a bit rushed (my fault‚ÄîI‚Äôd book 30 minutes earlier next time to enjoy it fully. Dinner is a bit slower service than the lunch, but totally understandable, as they were super full). Their tiramisu is phenomenal, and it‚Äôs definitely worth coming back for.

Small portion and they upcharge for almost any extras like meat, guacamole,  pickled onions, etc. I guess if you ordered a veggie burrito with no add-ons it would be somewhat reasonable in price but it quickly goes up even to just get meat. Besides the poor value, small portion and cold temperature,  it was genuinely one of  the most flavourless meals I've ever had. Disappointing, as they used to be fairly ok.

James and Dylan were our servers specifically and did a great job. They also have traditional music playing most nights, which can be pretty loud, but adds to the atmosphere. I‚Äôve also come here multiple times to dance and it is a fun place to go for a night out. It does tend to get packed and the space is pretty small so keep that in mind. (by Madison Day) [a month ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - Visited this place after seeing some good reviews as a spot to watch sport, but I left a bit disappointed.

Rice was good!
The chicken itself was good, the sauce bland - similar to a kebab shop!

Indian food isn‚Äôt complicated to make at all, just requires a lot of spices‚Ä¶ so to pay so much and to get a basic, below par quality and taste indicates to me the restaurant doesn‚Äôt care and is more concerned with quick margins than repeat business!

At the time of payment, the lady was going to keep ‚Ç¨8 euros that she owed me as tips but without doing scenes or saying too much I asked for the change. I‚Äôll definitely not go back. (by jannat hyder) [8 months ago] | Review 8: 3 stars - I must say that I was a bit baffled by the previous recent reviews, some of which were ravingly positive, with others simply horrified. We decided to give it a go anyway.
On the plus side, service was prompt and attentive, and we liked most of the food we ordered. I found my Chicken Madras especially good.
On the minus front, the place was still freezing two good hours after opening time. We had a heating element next to us, but the staff did not realise it was not plugged in. At times, the staff gave the slight impression of having been hurled into the job on the day before, but they were showing their good will anyway. I found my son's Butter Chicken far too bland and tasting exceedingly of - well, yes - butter, but he enjoyed it nonetheless.
I read others complain about an overpriced menu, but I have to say that, after scouring the Cork scene of Indian restaurants, Bombay Palace actually has slightly lower rates than most other comparable places (although the prices shown on their website have already been touched up).
Room for improvement, but I'm sure they are trying. (by Giorgio Berardi) [a year ago] | Review 9: 3 stars - I have been to this place quite a few times. Being a vegetarian, there are limited options, and the quantity of curry is too low for the price. Some of the restaurants serve a bowl of plain basmati rice with the curry, but this place doesn't.

The food was absolutely delicious and felt truly authentic. We tried the butter chicken and chicken balti with pilau rice, and each dish was bursting with rich, layered flavors. The butter chicken was creamy and perfectly spiced, while the balti had just the right kick without being overpowering. The pilau rice was fragrant and paired beautifully with both dishes.

The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, and the service was attentive without being intrusive. You can really taste the care that goes into the cooking here.

If you‚Äôre looking for authentic, flavorful Nepalese cuisine, this is definitely a place worth visiting. We went on a friend‚Äôs recommendation and would highly recommend it ourselves! (by Wayne Phair) [a month ago] | Review 7: 1 star - It wasn‚Äôt a pleasant experience. The welcome felt unfriendly, and the wait for our food was far too long. What made it more disappointing was that several surrounding tables‚Äîmostly groups of couples or parties of four or more‚Äîwere seated and ordered after us, yet they received their meals well before we did. By the time our food finally arrived, many of them were already finishing up. (by Ahmed Elbanna) [a week ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - 100% recommended. Best curry dishes I‚Äôve ever eaten. Honestly food was heaven. Dishes are big. Staff super kind and professional. Place so cozy and Nepali decorated. It‚Äôs located in the center. If you are in Cork, you must go and try their food. We asked for a starter and 2 main. We finished super full. (by Paty Lopez) [a year ago] | Review 9: 4 stars - The food was delicious! The chat samosa, the cheese garlic Naan and the Himalayan curry were all excellent! It was great to hear authentic background music instead of the ubiquitous sexy women of jazz! The atmosphere could be improved by having the lights a bit dimmer! A bit pricey but very good quality! We'll definitely be back!

Umi Falafel Cork,Cork,"11/12 Academy St, Centre, Cork, T12 T381, Ireland",Restaurant,4.6,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 4 stars - Visited this restaurant quite a while ago, but still remember the experience. We tried falafel without really knowing what it was at the time ‚Äî our first impression was that the taste was a bit bland, especially for an Asian palate. It felt more like eating healthy food than something flavourful.

The restaurant itself was quite small and crowded, which made the dining experience a bit less comfortable.

Overall, it was an interesting experience, but not something we‚Äôd rush back for. (by ieyla fadzil) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - SO GOOD. Got it fist time by deliveroo and wow it's the best!

Their menus and options are bit different than Dublin. Found a strand of hair in one of our bowls and lentils and rice didn't feel right.

When I arrived, I was warmly greeted by Hassan, who patiently indulged me as I dusted off my rusty Arabic. We had wonderful chats about his home country of Lebanon and all the beautiful places there.

For lunch, I ordered the Fattoush Salad (gluten-free) and Hummus, served with gluten-free bread. Both dishes were fresh, flavourful, and absolutely delicious. The hummus portion was so generous that I happily took the rest home.

The atmosphere was lovely ‚Äî I sat outside in the sunshine, enjoying my lunch and the relaxed vibe. This place offers great value for money, warm hospitality, and mouthwatering food. Mashallah! I‚Äôll definitely be back, inshallah. Shukran to Hassan and the whole team. A tonic for the souls who are looking for some authentic Middle Eastern cuisine. (by Ailish Heffernan) [a month ago] | Review 6: 1 star - Absolute ripoff - I would be ashamed to serve what I got today if I owned a restaurant. The shawarma sandwich I ordered was adding 1,50‚Ç¨ to the meal price (which is already pretty expensive since everything is plant-based, and the only drinks included in the meal are basic cans and bottles) and it was literally a flat piece of bread with only salad, a sliced tomato, and 3 pieces of mushroom drowned in sauce. Disgraceful - leaving a photo of what it looked like once the tomato was removed. I don‚Äôt remember the last time eating out left me so disappointed and angry, I strongly advise against eating there. (by Bridget) [4 months ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Friendly environment.

The food is fresh and we'll thought out. The flavors and textures are clearly forward-thinking without being pretentious or ""trying too hard."" We had the Huevos Rancheros, Berry French Toast, Bacon French Toast, and the Smokey Royale. All were delicious. The smoked salmon with its delicious oils, paired nicely with the slightly acid avocado base on the toast and the lemon in the hollandaise.
The Rancheros had a wonderful ""western"" flavor with very tender, not fatty, pork.
The French Toast was pefect. Light and crisp with bright flavors. (by Geoffrey Lavell) [6 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Phenomenal food. Staff were so lovely.

Fish cake was tasty nothing special. The steak is the issue. Literally could have used a chainsaw to cut it. Our table was shaking and our drinks were spilling because we were trying to cut the steak. It lacked flavour and just wasn‚Äôt worth the price. Won‚Äôt be ordering that again. Staff seemed new and weren‚Äôt the most attentive. I got a pornstar martini and it wasn‚Äôt great. I drank half of it and then ordered an espresso martini which was much better.

We didn‚Äôt try any of the food just went for drinks and the vibes were good (by Cora Keogh) [3 months ago] | Review 4: 1 star - Shocking and horrifying experience and food.
Will never return and beg anyone reading this not to go here.
The food is clearly all heated from frozen.
My food was dry, bland,chewy and the sauce was watery and flavourless.
The calamari was rubber in dried bread and not properly prepared,the nerves which are like natural rubber bands were not removed.
I could not finish the dish and was not charged for it when I showed the wait staff the strings of elastic in my food.
The food is clearly over plated in an attempt to distract from the horrific quality but the decorations are either flavourless coloured thickened water or squeeze bottle sauces from ice cream trucks.
Another horrifying experience was lying in wait in the bathrooms.
On the inside of the women's bathroom is a floor to ceiling, wall to wall pin up of a naked man- in the men's bathrooms there is a corresponding picture of a woman.
The toilets themselves are so tiny that I, a small 5""3 woman couldn't shut the door without my knees being pressed up against it. The food made me and everyone traveling  with me ill for the next day (by Lhamo Fitzsimons) [4 years ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - A small place, but the vibe of the restaurant is amaizing! The food is delicious, but maybe the portions are a bit small, so don't go there when you're starving, cause you wont leave the place with full stomach.

We had the beef enchiladas, smoked salmon, mozzarella sticks and the samosas. All of which were gorgeous. It is really nice to see pieces of beef in enchiladas rather than mince meat. It was also really good quality as was the smoked salmon. The samosas had a really lovely flavour as had the mozarella sticks. A must try if you like tapas and nice portions as well. (by Ann-michelle Mullally) [6 years ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Amazing food and service. My boyfriend and I got 4 separate dishes (to share) and each was as good as the next.

About the food I have mix feelings,the place was recommended by a friend. First of all minimum details missing from the table like salt and pepper and napkins‚Ä¶I was surprised to be honest‚Ä¶and intrigued on the same time,because this place is high spoken.
Eggs were fine cooked,soft as it should be,but no tasty.food on the place was plain ,although looked alright,but,no seasoning and,the hollandaise was not at the greatest quality either.
22,50 for eggs florentine and chips‚Ä¶ quiet expensive,in my opinion . 26,50 with dessert and no coffee .

Eager to experience a taste of the local culture, I decided to stop in for a refreshing drink. From the moment I entered, the barmaid (server) greeted me with genuine warmth, kindness, and a helpful attitude.

Taking note of my curiosity, she attentively listened to my preferences and offered a wonderful suggestion: Irish apple cider. It happened to be my first time trying cider, and I'm delighted to say it was a delightful choice. The cider was perfectly crafted, striking a harmonious balance between sweetness and crispness that left me longing for another sip.

The pub itself exuded a friendly and inviting atmosphere. Although the bustling bar area was occupied, the cozy coaches offered a serene spot for me to unwind and savor my drink. Immersed in the authentic Irish ambiance, I couldn't help but appreciate the genuine sense of camaraderie and enjoyment that permeated the air.

This impromptu visit to the Irish pub left a lasting impression on me. The attentive and amiable service provided by the barmaid, along with the exceptional Irish apple cider, contributed to a truly memorable experience. I relished every moment, immersing myself in the rich tapestry of Irish tradition and hospitality.

If you find yourself exploring the Port of Cork, I wholeheartedly recommend paying a visit to this charming pub. Whether you're a cider aficionado or simply seeking a genuine taste of Ireland, you'll be treated to a warm welcome, an inviting atmosphere, and a drink that will transport you to good places. (by Kouros Zanbouri) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 3 stars - What should be a gorgeous old school pub is ruined by screens. There are 2 huge TVs behind the bar showing 2 different sports that no one was watching while I was there. Added to this were 2 bright advertising screens running Guinness adds.
Their poor choice of strobing Christmas lights combine with the screens to create a very flashy amusement arcade like atmosphere.
Service was friendly and efficient.
This could be a beautiful pub. (by Soundy Sound) [9 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Post concert drinks,friendly staff nice atmosphere and cold drinks. (by Joce Coughlan) [a month ago] | Review 8: 3 stars - The atmosphere was quite non existent.  If it wasn't for our group, there'd have been a handful of elderly patrons in the bar. The best thing about the bar was in my opinion the service. We were served by a really nice girl who was polite and helpful to our group. The clientele was 100% male on the Saturday night we were there which I found rather unusual. Fine for a pint in the afternoon. (by Kevin Byrne) [a year ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Slow service but otherwise a lovely pub with so much character.

A great place to watch games, it has a load of tellies and there are always some people there watching so there is a bit of atmosphere.

Maybe a bit rough around the edges and a little out of the way but it has a charm about it and is worth the trip.

Service is shockingly slow though. (by Cillian) [a year ago] | Review 10: 4 stars - The idle Hour.

All food was wonderful! Garlic & cheese mushrooms, tomato soup, Fish & Chips, Barbary Duck & Chicken Curry! We also sampled desserts: Apple Pie & Brownie!
Nice walk back, to the Blackrock Carole Ville B&B, through the park. (by Dianna B) [a year ago] | Review 3: 1 star - Awful service, stay away

I was my sons 22nd birthday last night so I made a reservation for 5 to celebrate. We were seated in a booth woth two tables, 3 people at one table and 2 at the other. The tables could not be pushed together so we were a long way from each other. Funny setup but we laughed it off.

Then we ordered and were waiting for over an hour to receive food. My food was cold and overcooked, so I sent it back. I then had to wait another 30 mins for food. My family were finished by the time it arrived. It had a hair in it this time, but I couldn't be bothered saying it.

We had to collect my daughter from work so didn't have to time in the two hours we were there to have dessert. It was an utter shambles.

My wife overheard issues at other tables as well and the kitchen was under pressure because of an event upstairs apparently.

So here's a tip. Either staff up so you can cater for the numbers you take in, or limit the numbers you take in so you can give quality if service that reflects what you charge. It might also be an idea to train your very young and polite staff effectively. I felt sorry for them.

While I get you were busy, its not an excuse to me. There was nothing wrong with the 154 euro I earned and dropped for you to spoil our evening. I'm sure banks are very busy too but you still got paid on time and in full by me for a crap service. (by Anthony O'Regan) [2 weeks ago] | Review 4: 3 stars - I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. The garlic bread was to die for! The toasty sandwich and fudge cake were very good. The chicken parmesean wasn't great. The service was unfortunately really lacking. We sat ourselves and got our own menus at the direction of the bar tender. We were helped by multiple waiters at the start and then didn't see anyone for close to 45 minutes. A runner would come bring food to other tables near us but rush off before we could get her attention and the waiters were no where to be found. We finally caught the runner and asked for water and cake through her. After that we were left for awhile again and couldn't get someone to bring our bill. I'm hoping they just had a big event seated somewhere far into the restaurant or something and that's why they were so absent? Not sure if I'd return. (by Olivia McCarty) [4 months ago] | Review 5: 2 stars - Big bar with plenty of places to sit for big or small parties. Lots of nooks and crannies.
Food was OK but very overpriced. ‚Ç¨11.95 for small breakfast is just ludicrous.  The food itself was a big portion but nothing special.
Service was strange with my server calling me ""boy"" (might be a Cork thing) and second waitress wearing a full length coat tied up. It was cold in there.
Cleaner was also working while people were eating and was actually moping floors while customers were walking around which seemed a health hazzard.
Hard to give it a higher rating as owners reputation (bad) is also hard to ignore. (by kieran Kenneally) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 2 stars - Had breakfast recently, complete rip off. Had full Irish & mini as per the menu ‚Ç¨ 15.95 & ‚Ç¨ 12.95, acceptable enough. Total bill came to over ‚Ç¨ 40.00, teas & coffee were not part of the price on the menu. I'm not surprised why restaurants are closing down with this pricing structure. People want value for money!! The breakfast was ok, nothing to write home about, mushrooms must have been on special offer as the plate was full of them. I would be slow to go back there again. (by Colm O'Donoghue) [3 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - First time back here in years and breakfast was top notch. Full Irish not greasy or overcooked. Smashed avocado and feta also delicious. Service was exceptional, staff were knowledgeable, polite and attentive. Will be returning for dinner soon. Thanks ! (by Rory Kelleher) [5 months ago] | Review 8: 1 star - Haven‚Äôt been in for the last few months until just recently. Myself and my wife would have two mini breakfasts with tea included. We were served one breakfast with no sausage and besides all of that went up to pay the bill. Which would usually be 25.90 including the tea, on the bill the tea was now ‚Ç¨7.50 for a pot of tea. Which I think is crazy and a lot of others feel the same.

Service is exceptional as always. Regardless, won‚Äôt be back. (by Pat Duggan) [4 months ago] | Review 9: 3 stars - A little disappointed with the food. Not as tasty as my last visit. I had Eggs Benedict.

Service was very fast as well and most dishes come with a side of rice/chips. (by Emma Figueras) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Probably the best Chinese food I've had in Cork. The aromatic duck was delicious and came with a lotta meat and veggies.

For dessert they don't have a menu but have ice cream or a chocolate cake with cream. The cake was once again one of the best I've had. Moist and chocolatey!

We did have an ""accompaniment"" fee added to our table of 4 (3 euros per person) which presumably was the service fee. (by Karan Samani) [3 weeks ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - I know authentic Chinese dimsum and this is the best I've had in Europe, and I lived a bit everywhere. All of it seemed freshly made and was as good as one can possibly hope. Salt and pepper squid was the best I ever had, including in China! (by O. P.) [3 months ago] | Review 4: 3 stars - Food: Food was pretty decent. We had steamed prawn dumplings and they are absolutely authentic. I would have liked the size of the dumplings to be larger, but taste wise, they nailed it. We also ordered chicken in schezwan sauce and egg fried rice, it was absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend this dish, it‚Äôll give a nice taste to your palette. The hot and sour chicken soup was okay.

Service: Whilst the food was great, we found  however the service to be a bit slow.

Ambience: Ambience is really good and gives out cozy yet authentic vibes.

Overall, it was a pretty decent experience. (by Jaee Sakhalkar) [9 months ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - Visited on Sunday evening. The food was really good. The service was really good. I was a bit taken a back though when I was leaving,after already paying at the counter  when i was exiting the waitress said "" have ye paid? "" . Found that to be a little bit Insensitive having already paid the bill üëÄ  As a manager in a customer service facing role I certainly would not be nor be recommending my staff to deem that to be an appropriate way to approach a customer . Did I need to have the receipt in full view of the waitress when I was leaving  only because she didn't see me pay ?   Please look into this for yourselves going forward.    As I said food was lovely though outside of that and the other staff were great thoroughout our time there.

I liked all of the items and enjoyed them. I can't comment about whether they are authentic Chinese or not, the food was very very enjoyable for me. It's a great value for money Chinese place in Cork.

Can't post the dumpling picture as Google is flagging that picture. (by Arjun Pakrashi) [a year ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Beauty, cozy interior, perfect to relax in with tea and dim sum. The tea itself had an amazing flavour and worth going for alone.

Orso Kitchen & Bar,Cork,"8 Pembroke St, Centre, Cork, T12 YY90, Ireland",Lebanese restaurant,4.6,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Amazing dining experience with a touch of Middle Eastern cuisine. The staff are very friendly and the space is welcoming. Highly recommend trying their house stone baked bread that resembles flat bread. Warm out of the oven, it melts in your mouth. The hummus was also amazing and one of the best we've ever had with real good olive oil on top. The chicken was the best we've ever had, tender, refreshing with the touch of lemon sauce and perfectly matching the crispy layered potato cake and the roasted pumpkin. Overall, an amazing combination. Regarding desserts, if you don't have a sweet tooth, I wouldn't recommend the white chocolate dessert. Instead, I would go for the Middle Eastern milk pudding, very mild, comforting to digest with rhubarb and hibiscus compote that gives it an acid but perfectly balanced touch. Perfectly light to digest the meal. All ingredients are locally sourced. We'll definitely go back whenever we're next in Cork. (by Iris) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Amazing food, 10/10!

Whilst the food is wonderful and well presented it‚Äôs not a place I‚Äôll go back to again due to the owners behaviour (by Mick O Brien) [3 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Great portions for a reasonable price.

I ordered a French toast and decided to add an order of sausages, which I ended up, not eating because of portions were large. We went in with two adults and a stroller (buggy) and sta inside- small space but was just enough. The service was great and so was the holiday cheer. We will define coming back to the place.

The toilets are located outside. (by Gabs G.) [2 years ago] | Review 7: 3 stars - The sausage bap was dripping in butter, and I like butter. Unfortunately the sausages were tasteless and not appealing.
The cakes looked wonderful but were very dense. The lemon curd would benefit from a lighter mix. The coffee cake is again very dense with a very bitter aftertaste.

We walked by this place on the street and had to stop. The staff are helpful and patient and nice. The lamb is very flavorful and tender.

(by Mark Pittman) [a month ago] | Review 2: 3 stars - First of all, this is was first time having kebab in this place.

I didn‚Äôt know what I was gonna order so I decided to ask for recommendations. I told them I could wait until the line was empty , but the staff there were super nice and extremely helpful, giving me their best recommendation even though they were pretty busy.

I went with what they recommended, which was a mix kebab platter (half chicken, half lamb). It also came with garlic sauce, some spicy one (which was very good), salad and some bread underneath it. The meal option also comes with rice/fries. You can also ask it to be a 50/50 mix.

The food was tasty, well-made and pretty good, but I thought that spending almost ‚Ç¨17 on this dish (it included a drink) was a bit overpriced for what it is.

The atmosphere was grand. Not much to say, honestly. The design isn‚Äôt the best, but it isn‚Äôy dirty or anything like that. Just not that visually appealing.

Overall, a 6.5 / 7.0 experience. (by Lucas Raiol) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - We had just gotten off of a long flight and then a three-hour drive with an 8 month old baby, so we were definitely not trying to go to a restaurant for dinner. We were in the mood for some kebabs and found Istanbul and stopped in on a Sunday at around 9 PM. We had the doner kebab, and some kind of platter that had chicken, beef, and lamb. Our total came out to almost $40 USD! That‚Äôs more than NYC prices! It was a pretty big portion, but I don‚Äôt think it was $40 worth. Plus, the meats were kind of dry. It could have used some more sauce.

Jacques Restaurant,Cork,"23 Oliver Plunkett St, Centre, Cork, T12 A5D7, Ireland",Irish restaurant,4.4,,,,,"Review 1: 4 stars - We went on a team night out and the place and atmosphere of this place is class. It might look very small at the outside but very big on the inside.Their servers was very approachable and accommodating as well. Food was ok for me. I would say my expectations were a little bit not met. For a 30-40 euro steak, I would have expected that the steak is at least seasoned which was not. The sharing platter as well was a little bit  small for me. I expected at least a couple of meats and more cheese on a meat and cheese board but as you can see on the picture that‚Äôs their sharing board and you can see on the menu how much that is. My teammates enjoyed their veggie board and they were delighted with the taste. Their desert was great as well. Overall still a good experience. Just get your wallets ready as food can be pricey. (by Paul Richard Bungay) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Wonderful dining experience and friendly staff. The tomahawk is seasoned well and big enough to share. Extensive drink menu including low/no alcohol drinks and wines on tap. The affogato comes with a brownie and add-on liquor. Note that the online sample menu doesn't match the live menu so a few things were not on offer that we were hoping to try.

‚úîÔ∏èMussels escabeche
‚úîÔ∏èRoast quail

Delightful dinner affair with impeccable ambiance, in my humble opinion. After a futile search through four restaurants, stumbling upon this gem was a stroke of luck. I had noticed it during a leisurely evening stroll and was instantly captivated.

The warm welcome upon entry sealed the deal for me; the charming lady and the attentive staff were absolute darlings, truly enhancing my evening.

Starting with the mussels was a light and flawless choice. When I spotted quail on the menu, I knew it was meant for me. The creamy polenta resembled a heavenly bed, complemented by a delicate touch of pesto oil that harmonized all the flavors beautifully. The quail itself was cooked to perfection, just as I prefer.

Shake Dog,Cork,"97-98 S Main St, Centre, Cork, T12 DX53, Ireland",Hamburger restaurant,4.1,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 4 stars - A great alternative to the bigger fast food takeaway restaurants. I would say Shake dog has a lot more variety and choice to choose from. The Hawaiian Burger was delicious and very filling. The staff are very helpful and friendly and hard working. Giving that extra bit of service that you do not get in other fast food takeaways.  It is spacious with plenty of seating for all and good for large groups or even if you just want to drop in yourself. Great selection of burger meals and tastefully cooked. The price was reasonably affordable at ‚Ç¨12.95. The only reason it did not get 5 stars was because of the small portion of chips a few more extra chips and this would be well up there for value. As for now it is a great place to visit and very affordable for what is served big delicious tasty burgers by attentive staff.would definitely recommend and will call back in again. (by Mr Walsh) [4 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - We came here to eat because of the meal deal that they have and the combo was super good. Hamburger plus fries and milkshake for 10 euros. Dude was a good meal the hamburger is good the milk shake as well. Definitely it is a good place for hanging out with your friends. And then move to the clubs. Check the business working hours bcuz on google maps is wrong the close until 11 pm. (by Eduardo Alday) [a month ago] | Review 3: 1 star - Unfortunately this place has really gone downhill, used to be one of our favourite spots in the city for food.

They‚Äôve gone really scaldy with the milkshakes- only fill it 3 quarters of the way now (and they‚Äôve changed the flavor of the vanilla milkshake?!?!)

All the portion sizes are way smaller- the chips are tiny too. Between the table of 4 of us, there was a burger, breakfast and tenders and none of us really liked our meals.

I got the breakfast and didn‚Äôt eat half of it- I got about 6 baked beans!üòÇüòÇ a mouse would be pissed if he only got 6 scaldy beans. The rashers were inedible, the eggs were just bad. The toast was barely toasted.

Also, the waiter was just so not bothered whatsoever. None of the staff were nice to be honest, could be the bosses fault, who knows.

Unfortunately won‚Äôt be back which is a pity, as it used to be great (by Rachel C) [6 months ago] | Review 4: 1 star - Waiter was nice but my chicken burger tasted like my nans knickers and my gf refused to have her shake when I tasted it I didn‚Äôt blame her it tasted like soapy water from the sink and milk horrible stuff , we were extremely hungry so we ate it but were left very disappointed.

Remember going to these places 10 years ago or so with my family when it was Eddie Rockets and it was very nice but clearly no one in these places care any more.

The cheese on my chips tasted like molten play dough on my chips.

Overall thoughts: Yocky (by Adam Tyrrell) [a week ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - One of my go-to spots in Cork! Shake Dog never disappoints. The burgers are juicy and full of flavor, and the fries are always crispy and perfectly seasoned. Their milkshakes are hands down the best I‚Äôve had‚Äîthick, creamy, and just the right amount of sweetness. The staff are super friendly and always make you feel welcome. Service is fast even when it‚Äôs busy, and the place has a fun, relaxed atmosphere. Whether you‚Äôre grabbing a quick bite or sitting down with friends, it‚Äôs a great experience every time. Definitely a five-star spot for comfort food lovers! (by Bayezid Ahmed) [4 months ago] | Review 6: 1 star - I decided to visit Shake Dog after hearing good things about it, but I left feeling extremely disappointed with the overall experience. From the beginning, the restaurant did not meet the standard I was expecting. The portion sizes were surprisingly small and not reflective of the price charged. The food itself was poorly prepared, tasted processed, and lacked freshness. Unfortunately, we could not finish our meals due to both the unpleasant taste and presentation.

What made matters worse was the attitude of the manager. Rather than being welcoming or professional, they came across as impolite and dismissive. At one point, we were even charged more than what we had ordered, and only after raising the issue was the mistake reluctantly corrected. This left a very negative impression of both the management and the establishment‚Äôs approach to customer service.

In terms of value, the pricing is excessive for what is essentially frozen, low-quality food. The limited selection of drinks only added to the disappointment. The restaurant‚Äôs cleanliness was also far below acceptable standards. I noticed stains on the walls, spills that hadn‚Äôt been cleaned, and even ketchup marks on the ceiling. The overall environment felt neglected and unhygienic, which made it uncomfortable to sit and eat.

The customer service did nothing to improve the situation. Staff seemed disinterested and unengaged, and there was no effort to make customers feel welcomed or looked after. Given the lack of quality in the food, the poor service, and the unsanitary atmosphere, I cannot recommend Shake Dog. I left not only dissatisfied but also with an upset stomach, which further confirms the poor quality of the food being served.

This experience was highly disappointing from start to finish. I will not be returning, and I would strongly advise others to consider alternative dining options that value both their customers and the quality of the food they serve. (by Nat) [2 weeks ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - An amazing pocket friendly diner. The mean meal is an amazing deal and covers most of the menu items. A burger- side and a shake. Great portion size, easy on the pocket .
Had tried multiple times by ordering it for home delivery but it tasted so much better having it fresh in the restaurant itself. Very sumptuous. (by Prajwal Gopal) [2 years ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Very nice place, the North American retro decoration caught my attention. The prices are good. You can have the ‚Äúshake dog deal‚Äù that includes one burger, one side and one shake for ‚Ç¨10. You have to pay at the register on your way out. They also have delivery and take away. We had the smoking veggie Burguer and the cheese burger and they were delicious. The chips comes with the sauce within it and with cheese on the top, also very good. The shakes were also nice but we ordered the Nutella one and it could have a bit more Nutella on it. (by Beatriz Garcez) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 1 star - This used to be an absolute gem a few years ago. What used to be a signature full to the brim milkshake with a huge amount of cream on top spilling over with chunks of oreo etc, turned to a 2/3 full glass with INSANELY watered down milkshake, where all you taste is whipped cream with a tiny bit of flavour.

Waited 30+ mins while the venue was super quiet, only to be give a hot dog and burger which were both extremely plain, zero flavour. We weren't the only ones unhappy with the food either, two groups left their food unfinished and the other complained about their orders being wrong.

So sad and disappointing, it used to be fantastic. Effort used to be put in, not anymore. Whatever new management did is not good at all.

(by Akhil Cheriyan) [5 months ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - They were kind to fit us in on a busy Friday night. Alessia was our server and very sweet.  Cocktails were super fresh and had unique flavor profiles.  I had the Side Hustle,  and although it has Jalape√±o infused tequila,  the lime and agave cut the spiciness way down.  The Chicken with Mushroom Risotto was a solid dish,  could have used a bit more seasoning for my liking.  Chicken was tende and juicy, the combo of mushrooms gave great texture to the risotto. The steak was a perfect medium rare and flavors were nice, however,  I had a weird situation with my potato side dish.  I switched the mash the steak came with for the Colcannon, a local dish that is mash mixed with fresh cabbage, at the servers recommendation.  When the kitchen delivered the meal, I asked if these were the special potatoes, she looked confused, so I continued by adding ""the ones with the cabbage?"" She said she didn't know and rushed my plate back to the kitchen.  After several minutes passed, our server came to check and I explained that I had just asked to confirm I had gotten the right side. Side said I confused her when I said special. üòê  They finally redelivered my meal, after several more minutes, while my husband waited for me, and the potatoes were stone cold.  Alessia checked back and I told her the potatoes were very cold,  and she said they are supposed to be warm and not hot.  What?! This was pretty frustrating considering the food runner wasn't even sure what she was bringing to the table when I asked a simple question, and now I'm being told these ice cold potatoes are supposed to be like this?!  This was so awkward,  and I was ready to just leave. She returned shortly with steaming hot potatoes, which tasted pretty good.  Overall,  the evening wasn't ruined,  but it definitely put a damper on it. Overall,  good food,  just don't say special üòâ (by Heather Manz) [4 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Excellent service with incredible food.

Orchids Restaurant,Cork,"Hayfield Manor Hotel, Perrott Ave, College Rd, Centre, Cork, T12 HT97, Ireland",Modern European restaurant,4.0,,,,,"Review 1: 4 stars - Overall this establishment offered a solid dining experience with high quality food and friendly professional service. Evening service seemed a bit short staffed which did not allow our server to present herself as frequently as we would have preferred. I do not fault the server as this seemed to be more of a staffing issue.  Obvious regulars two tables down were fawned upon while hotel guests, such as ourselves, did not get the same service level. For the price of both the hotel and the restaurant this was disappointing. Breakfast service was a bit spotty.  The first morning it was exceptional. The second morning it was a bit off. The food quality for all meals was excellent and the plate presentations were well done. The dining room itself was classy contemporary.  Noise volumes allowed conversations to be heard.

I had been wanting to visit this restaurant for the past 4 years living in Cork. Overall, I am slightly disappointed in all areas. Especially, considering its prestige and price. Starting with the food: although enjoyable; there is a lot of room for improvement. I personally tried the scallops, the duck, and the apple parfait. The scallops lacked depth of flavor, and were in my opinion overcooked. The acai sorbet, although a nice and refreshing idea, lacked any memorable qualities or garnish. The duck, although juicy and cooked right in the middle, had a very soggy skin. The orange flavor that was meant to complement it was also very mild. The desert was my favorite dish, and it was unique and tasty but my partners desert, the berry mousse, had (literally) half a strawberry served with it, then the menu said ""served with fresh berries"". The wine selection was impressive and I enjoyed our drinks, although our first pinot grigio was noticeably cheap.

The service was a mixed bag. All the servers and staff were very friendly and I have no complaints in that regard. That said, we all came with heavy coats, and no one offered to pick them up for us. Additionally, we were all asked to order desert off the bat, which is unusual and delayed our order. Finally, when we left, we had to pick up our coats our selves.

Finally on the atmosphere. This historic building should receive the utmost of respect and attention in decor. The flooring, armchairs, curtains, chandeliers and room layout did not honor its history. The small details, such as lighting, and set up (uninviting spotlights, grey plastic laminate flooring, one candle per table that weren't turned on etc..) do not reflect the class the restaurant should hold.

On a positive note, the live piano was lovely, and added to the experience, especially because the player himself was not only lovely, but also also highly skilled. That said, the repertoire should be adjusted, as we were confused when they started playing the game of throne TV show intro music, instead of perhaps soft jazz, or classical pieces.

Overall, I did have a great time, and i don't have anything negative to say about any particular staff, or their friendliness, but considering this restaurant is within a 5 star hotel, with a very high price range, i did not feel this was reflected in the areas stated above. Worth a visit, but I'd be more inclined to attend the afternoon tea, or the lovely bar.

Judging from the prices (12/15‚Ç¨ each) we mistakenly thought that one portion was enough for one person, but when we saw the quantity (too small even for a kid) we were baffled and we couldn't understand whether the 15‚Ç¨ price included all the 3 tiny dishes or only a single one. To eat a proper dinner we should've ordered at least other 2 dishes for each of us and spend at least other 50‚Ç¨.
In total we spent 60‚Ç¨ for a portion of patatas bravas (quite expensive, but fair) and 3 tiny portions of chorizo + 2 cokes because the water tasted awful.

Service is always good, they have a good bar, prices are fine, and food is usually tasty. Not your average Cork pub/restaurant. You won‚Äôt get a fully authentic Irish pub experience here, but I‚Äôd recommend for a nice meal and a good view. (by Kevin McCabe) [7 months ago] | Review 9: 4 stars - We loved the food! Great work! Cocktail choice was a bit poor. I like gin and tonic and they had very little choice for it. Majority of cocktails were in a sweet side. The music wasn‚Äôt too loud but also much more like a club and we were in romantic dinner‚Ä¶ Staff wasn‚Äôt proactive to ask us questions and clean table etc but once called they would serve very fast (by Anastasia Almiasheva) [8 months ago] | Review 10: 1 star - I just edited my review, they charged us for tap water, we didn't request 2‚Ç¨ marking it as filtered water! The bottle was clearly refilled and was brought complementary with the cocktails. The price was not changed even when we pointed it out. Sadly this is a place to be careful with details on the bill.

The duck leg salad was fantastic. The truffle fries are also very good. If you are considering having the apple crumble, maybe think twice, it looks good but is meh.

(by Alexis Creedy) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Delicious spot for some breakfast, brunch, and lunch.

I've been wanting to go in for a long time, and I am so glad we finally visited.

Great breakfast options, steering away from your usual full irish, fresh produce and amazing, well cooked eggs with just the right amount of seasoning and not too wet or too dry.

Delicious coffee and the Organic A√ßa√≠ Smoothie in a bowl is such a nice touch!

Prices are also very competitive at just ‚Ç¨7 for the portions you receive is amazing! (by Callum Young) [2 years ago] | Review 7: 1 star - Honestly do not recommend this place. I was hungry and I couldn't even eat the food fully. I went it to the till  it took the 2 servers a while as it seemed like neither of them wanted to serve me. I ordered a sandwich and a cup of tea. The tea was fab but that is the most easy thing. Now the sandwich I think it was the flying bacon oh Jesus christ. I asked for ciabatta bread the bread I got i don't know what it was but it was rock hard I don't know if the sandwich was supposed to be hot or cold. As the cheese was melted at the edges and  the outside tasted warmish while the middle was cold, the ingredients didn't feel fresh like the tomato in it felt like it had been in the sandwich for a while. It tasted disgusting and left a bad taste in my mouth even a few minutes after. I couldn't eat it. The place looks okay it just needs a few improvements (by Reviewer-Elisabeth) [4 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Enjoyed a yummy breakfast here during our visit to Cork.

The place is dimly lit with an awesome retro vibe. And the food? It was incredible! Delicious salad, delicious wings, and a very handy kids meal. They even have a song bingo game on Thursdays. I wouldn't change a thing
100% recommend for any occasion. (by nick v) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Delicious and great value for money for the food in An Br√≥g. I went with the Classic burger that comes with nice chunky chips. The Classic burger it's self was a 6oz monster it felt moe like a very tasty double quarter pounder. One of the most messiest and tastiest burgers I had in long time. Glad I could just about finish it.
Be prepared, this is a delicious juicy messy burger! Fast service great chef, great bar staff. The inside of the pub the decor and vibe is decorated very interestingly and very cozy. Grabs your attention where ever you look.  The DJ box made of a little camper van is a great centre piece. It also has  a football table machine for a bit of fun. (by Mr Walsh) [11 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Very good burgers , chips are 10/10 (super crispy and beautifully seasoned, paprika amongst other spices). They have 2 for 1 on most days and ‚Ç¨5 Nacho Fridays. Music is very mainstream not my scene but also a great pub for a good night. (by Marty Butler) [11 months ago] | Review 4: 1 star - The place is amazing, with great music and fun weekly activities. However, there‚Äôs something more important than everything else to me: the staff! I visited on a public holiday, and one of the staff members was incredibly aggressive and unhappy. An alternative lady, who was supposed to be helpful, had an inadequate posture with me and my friend because we didn‚Äôt want to participate in the Quiz. It was unnecessary and some people really don‚Äôt know how to work in a hospitality service. Unfortunately, it seems like the company is lost in this situation because there are 100 others pubs in Cork where this kind of behavior is not tolerated. (by Danilo Matias) [4 months ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - Atmosphere is unreal, but the only issue is the staff, left with my friend for two minutes and couldn't get back in, the bouncer said he ""didn't see us leave"" after making direct eye contact while leaving. Our phones and coates were still inside, and we only got them back after my friends sister brought them out. Great Atmosphere, but genuinely hostile and unreasonable bouncers.

Younger, boisterous late night crowd which is ideal for partiers and boisterous youths, which clearly didn't deter me from staying til closing. I was surprised to find out the next day that the alleyway was an entrance to the English Market near the fishmongers. I was also surprised to learn they also serve food, which I didn't know about until just now when I began to write this review so I can't really speak to that. Decent beers, healthy shot pours, and late night hours.

We shared the porter house steak was cooked to perfection. (by Eamonn Boland) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - What a wonderful first night in Cork!

Evelien really looked after us; what great craic, great knowledge and she helped us tailor the menu to our dietary needs. I was a bit freaked out to discover the wine pairing would be mostly natural wines which aren‚Äôt usually my fave - but she knows her stuff and has a lot of great choice. I really enjoyed all the wines in the end, even loved that she found a way to charm me into the natural wine movement lol.

And the meal was sensational. So many beautiful ingredients, the freshest of seafood and produce. Everything cooked so skilfully and delicately, and some flavour and texture combos that will stay with me (in particular the smoked tomatoes with the lobster ü§§). We did the tasting menu and got the lobster extra - so glad we got to try it. Everything came out looking amazing, and the staff were really good at telling us all about each dish. Sometimes that kinda service level can feel a bit pretentious but here it just comes across that they love why they do.

And the chef came to say hi for dessert which was a lovely touch. Seems a genuinely nice bloke.

Goldie,Cork,"128 Oliver Plunkett St, Centre, Cork, T12 X5P8, Ireland",Seafood restaurant,4.8,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Located on Plunkett Street which is one of the many lively bar streets but on the good side (the other side of Plunkett is filled with vagrants and beggars)

I canceled my other dinner once I was able to book a table here. Enter into a young woman chef who made her bones at Elbow Lane, her modern take a fish (seafood) forward restaurant that's ever changing based on the contents of the freshest catch.

Not fussy but luxe. I requested bar seating so had front row view of the efficiency and attention to detail the kitchen staff took to everything from expedite to managing the front of house staff.

Word to the wise their small plates showcase the immense talent of Aishling and her chef de cuisines:

For my order :

Taiwan fish nuggets; beautiful rendition on my childhood favorite Taiwanese popcorn chicken, which uses white pepper for nostalgia feel that always sparks joy. Goldie's take has more Indian spices which was lovely and the fish was fried to perfection, not greasy whatsoever. How Chef Anna didn't get the famous basil pop in the oil, I'll never figure out....perhaps that's why she gets paid the big bucks! Incredible technique.

Cod schnitzel; gherkin and celeriac combo is one of my favorites with a twist by adding more Dijon mustard reminded me of my last trip to Lyon. Soy sauce cured egg yolk will add the additional saltiness the dish craves on anything fried.

Pibil cod head & cheek sope; the sope was one of the best executions I've seen since Pujol's (MXC) version. How this dish doesn't become soggy and gross speaks to their talent.

Main: pan roasted to perfection monkfish with beetroot achar, apple katkut - look my pictures. un fing real. Monkfish is seldomly seen in the states and when I do make it it's usually chopped up in congee with tons of ginger and scallions. Love this French? take of this ugly ass fish lol

Fish tends to be a lighter option for dinner, so with any luck you‚Äôll have room for dessert; i was completely stuffed by made the right decision in ordering caramelized white chocolate with the Achill Island sea salt and milk sorbet and the bucket wheat cracker. Unbelievable touch that was light air and not cloying.

Whilst sitting at dinner I found out Chef Aishling was recently awarded Ireland's Best Chef 2024 and Goldie is listed as the #2 restaurant in Ireland's Top 100 restaurants. The Bib Gourmand rating is what brought us here, and they were absolutely correct.

Chef Rob - expedition was exceptional. His command of the job came second nature to him, being able to manage several chefs and front of staff. Giving meaningful instruction without being overly dominant yet letting his young staff express  their creativity is what talented Chefs do. Really appreciate him coming by to check up on me after the service.

Chef Anna - plating was gorgeous and really appreciated her time expanding on each dish to me in person, such a lovely hospitality touch. This is totally an aside, but she was the most beautiful woman I've ever seen on my trip to Ireland. she's an absolute beauty.

Front of staff was excellent - I showed up 30 mins early to my reservation but suggested I grab a drink over at Brennan's. Really enjoyed it! (by Sun Lee) [a week ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Goldie came highly recommended on social media and online and we were absolutely delighted to say it lives up to the hype. Everything was delicious and the chef has a masterful touch with flavors and textures and honors the local ingredients beautifully. Our server was helpful with recommendations and happy to answer any of our questions. Make sure to get a reservation as we noticed many people try to walk in and they had to be turned away. Prices were reasonable‚Äîparticularly considering the quality of the ingredients and beautiful presentation. Everything was delicious (including the dessert) and this was the best food we‚Äôve be had in Ireland so far.  We also love the commitment of the chef to sustainability and minimizing food waste. 11/10 would recommend to anyone visiting cork who is looking for an excellent meal!

One of the best meals of my life. This had been on my list to book for ages. Very warm welcome on arrival. Always great to see an open kitchen and watch chefs work in front of you.

[2 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - On our second full day in Ireland, we ventured to the town of Cork, the 2nd largest city in the Republic of Ireland.  We had a lot of options to choose from in deciding where to eat as Cork has an absolute wealth of amazing vegan friendly places.  While it was difficult to choose, we opted for Sonflour, a completely vegetarian and mostly vegan Italian restaurant in the main shopping area about halfway between the North Channel and the South Channel of the River Lee.

We were blown away with our whole experience there.  The ambiance is just so far removed from that which we've encountered locally in the states, it was quaint, charming, rustic and all things in-between.  Italian food is one of those cuisines that can be challenging to find vegan options so we were intrigued with the idea of a whole restaurant dedicated to vegetarian/vegan food Italian fare.

For starters, we ordered what I believe to be Focaccia Bread but I forget the ,specific menu name.  Being a big fan of seaweed, I had to order their ""Better Call Saul..ad"" (get it? saul..ad .. salad ... lol :) ) ""A small fresh salad, made with local Seaweed, Rocket, Carrots, Cherry Tomatoes, Balsamic Vinegar, Seeds, Truffle oil and Vegan Mayonnaise.  Both were absolutely a divine treat on the palate, bursting with flavor, true story!

For our main dish, we both ordered Ravioli, Sandi having ordered the ""Vintage sauce - Our Slow Cooked Tomato Sauce made with Fresh Vegetables and Mediterranean, Herbs, Basil Leaves and Evoo"" and for me, the ""Sunflower‚Äôs soul sauce - Homemade Fresh Vegan Pesto, Baked Roasted Potatoes, Cherry Tomatoes and Evoo, Pine Nuts and Edible Flowers"".  Words cannot hope to do these dishes justice so I'll simply say, the dish melted in our mouths!

For dessert, we chose ""Affogato Italian coffee-based dessert. 2 scoops of Vegan Local Vanilla Ice Cream drowned with a shot of our hot Organic Espresso Giuliano"". You need simply look at the attached picture to know everything you need to know about how good this was.

We simply could not be happier with our choice of cuisine while in Cork.  While we would have loved if we had more time to try other options, Sonflour left an incredibly lasting impression.

You'd think for how great the atmosphere is, how wonderful the staff are, how tasty and fresh the food is, that this place would be more expensive - but no!
Incredible vegan and vegetarian Italian food, sustainable ethos, and the best vibes.
Genuinely though, I can't overstate how amazing this food is. But pleaseeeee book in advance. You are NEVER going to be able to walk in and get a table because the food is too good
Please bury me with the sweet garlic bread (by AJ Nagle) [5 months ago] | Review 10: 3 stars - Food is absolutely amazing. However the experience let us down‚Ä¶
We booked dinner on a Thursday night and we were there on time. But we were not made aware by the staff that we need to return the table in 2 hours. So the whole meal we felt really rushed by the staff. Ordered cocktails,starter, main and dessert. Starter plate came with water on it‚Ä¶ had to wipe it away with napkin; while we were having the starter, the staff already brought our main and apologized that their main was cooked too quickly - at that point, we already felt rushed by the staff. When eating main, staff checked if she could take our plates away once. But I didn‚Äôt finish my food and still have my fork in my hand‚Ä¶ later we were told we have to give the table back within 20min.. if we want to order dessert.. this is the first time we were made aware of the 2 hour rule and understood the why staff kept rushing us‚Ä¶  the staff served one of the dessert with chocolate stain on it ü´†ü´†ü´† disgusting ü´† no time to bother, we finished it very quickly and of course receipt came in super quickly without asking.. cuz staff is in a rush to get us out‚Ä¶(deleted the service fee part- thankfully we weren‚Äôt charged service fee for the service)

Food is amazing- but the experience was not nice.. if you could kindly made your customer aware of the 2 hour table rule before they order, I am sure every customer would understand and plan their order and time for eating accordingly‚Ä¶apologies if some of your customers do not read your online notice properly and expect your in-store staff to take a few seconds to give a reminder ‚Ä¶ (by L W) [4 months ago]",https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sonflour/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x484491a4bcf17b05:0xc8002f418ec0b397!8m2!3d51.8985422!4d-8.4768544!16s%2Fg%2F11q8jgvkvn!19sChIJBXvxvKSRREgRl7PAjkEvAMg
The Abbot's Ale House,Cork,"17 Devonshire St, Victorian Quarter, Cork, T23 X799, Ireland",Beer hall,4.8,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Despite me living quite a distance from the city and it taking quite a while to get in each time. I can wholeheartedly say that this pub is my local haunt. Great beers, great atmosphere, cracking conversation and great staff. Highly recommend giving it a visit for a taste of the alternative side of cork pubs. (by Adam Buckley (PHNX)) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Just a brilliant craft beer bar! Anton, the owner, is a massive character who knows who he is - we shared laughs,  shots, and beers with him when he wasn't singing with the band - what a treat.

Shout out to Finbar also,  who works the bar - a quintessential Irish character who was an absolute hoot to share stories and shots with. A brilliant couple of nights in a bar with a terrific beer selection and people who care about craft beer.  I couldn't recommend this place more highly. (by Tony Anetts) [10 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Was down in Cork on a job and staying in a hotel next to the Abbot.. Great place, lovely staff. Big shout to the owner and his pal. Can't remember your names. Will definitely be back!
Best pub in the City üòéüíØ (by Ross Henderson) [5 days ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - During our recent visit to Cork, we were fortunate enough to stumble upon The Abbot's Ale House, and it quickly became the highlight of our trip! From the moment we walked in, we were struck by the incredibly warm and welcoming atmosphere of the pub. It‚Äôs the kind of place where the staff genuinely care about making you feel at home.

To begin with, we were especially touched by the musicians, The D's, who were performing that evening. In a wonderful display of hospitality, they actually paused their performance to greet us personally and make us feel welcome‚Äîsomething you don‚Äôt experience every day! It‚Äôs these little gestures that really set this pub apart and made us feel like we were part of the family.

The owner of the pub was equally generous, going out of his way to ensure our comfort. In fact, when we couldn‚Äôt find a seat, he offered us his own chair, an act of kindness that made us feel truly valued as guests. It‚Äôs rare to encounter such genuine hospitality, and it made our experience even more special.

As for the selection of drinks, they offer a fantastic variety of beers that caters to all tastes. Whether you're a fan of local craft brews or international favorites, you'll find something to enjoy here.

The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with beautiful, thoughtful decoration that creates a relaxed, yet vibrant space. The pub's interior has a charm that makes it feel both timeless and contemporary, offering a perfect setting for a quiet drink or a lively night out.

A final mention must go to the barman, who made our visit even more memorable. Not only was he of incredible advice on the nightlife in the city, but his sense of humor and hugging skills made him the best bartender we encountered in Cork. A true testament to the pub's friendly vibe, he helped make our time at The Abbot‚Äôs unforgettable.

Overall, The Abbot's Ale House is a must-visit for anyone in Cork looking for great beer, warm hospitality, and a cozy space to relax and enjoy the local culture. We can‚Äôt recommend it enough! (by L√©a Ludwiller) [7 months ago] | Review 5: 1 star - First off, a little context, I'm an American-Irish dual citizen (mother and family born & raised in Dublin/Kildare). Secondly, have been living in Cork for 9 years trying hundreds of pubs and have never had this bad of an experience.

I was having a nice chat with an Irish Farmer, talking about agriculture, beef price increases, etc etc. and the owner pointed at a sign on the wall (which appears to be written by a child) and said ""No talking politics"". I replied, ""since when is agriculture and economy politics"". So off on the wrong foot from the get go.

Afterwards, there was a gap of 2 seats between myself and the Irish local and when some tourists walked into the gap to order, the owner said, ""Shh, be quiet, they're ordering"". The Irishman closed the gap by sitting next to me and we continued our farm-like banter to the dismay of- again, the owner.

Later on, a Finnish friend of mine and I were talking military subjects, and I mentioned my previous military training back in the states, which includes mock battles in the desert, gun range target practice, and receiving gun certifications. The Russian owner then absolutely lost the plot and got a fingers length away from my face and said aggressively ""Don't lie, don't lie, I served in the Russian armed forces and worked for Interpol"" to which I replied ""They didn't teach you to listen did they, I said trained with military guys and have some firearm training and certifications, never said I served, that's called stolen valour and is a felony"".

Even the Irish farmer was fed up and left the pub.

The owner also closed the pub at 10:00pm (which is illegal) due to a yellow status thunderstorm which amounted to a little drizzle for 2 hours.

In summary, you can find these unique beers at several other pubs in Cork city, (like the Bierhaus) and not have to experience the abuse , suppression of free speech, illegal closing times, and boring atmosphere of the most overrated pub in Cork city.

Is this a pub or The Gulag? (by Patrick Brennan) [3 months ago] | Review 6: 3 stars - It's an interesting pub, no doubt but the prices are ridiculous when compared to other craft beer bars in the city. ‚Ç¨8 for a 5.5% Irish IPA? ‚Ç¨4 for a half pint or Irish red?? It's not so special a bar to justify those prices. (by Soundy Sound) [2 weeks ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Best pub in town!
Great beers, good price, delicious snacks and amazing atmosphere.
I will come back next time in Cork indeed.
Highly recommend. (by M√≥nica Afonso) [a year ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - 2023 Update: this is still the best beer spot in Cork. üçª

Original post: If you like beer, and are looking for a change from the Irish stouts and Coors Light served in every pub, then you MUST visit Abbot‚Äôs Ale House. I lived in Cork for a year before we discovered it, and I feel like a year has been wasted. This is now my favorite bar in Cork. Why? The rotating beer list, the variety of can offerings, the fact that it is also a full bar, the vibe, the quaintness of it, the music, the people, the friendly owner. It checks every box for me. Even the box for Imperial Stout Slushy! The only down side is the hours of operation which are limited.
Again, if you like beer, then go.

We were happy that the place is not packed and we are able to secure a seat. The atmosphere is very pleasant and they have a very wonderful staff and that‚Äôs the only reason why I‚Äôm giving a three rating rather than a one. I was very disappointed with the food that they served. It just looks nice but the taste is terrible. It felt that the person cooking it did not like what they are doing. The miso soup is fishy, the rice is not freshly prepared. It tastes like it was prepared yesterday and was just served to us. The rice was not even warm when it was served. The beef teriyaki seems to be heated from a microwave and the chef sushi could not even  be called a ‚Äúchef sushi‚Äù. The salmon also tastes like it was cooked in the morning and just reheated. I did not feel any freshness at all in the food preparation. This was one of the places I was looking forward to visit but it was a very disappointing experience. All that wonderful customer service and great ambiance only to be ruined by the food served.

I ordered steak, vegetables and potatoes. Everything was extremely over salted. Honestly I should have given this dish back because even I like salty things but it was simply impossible to eat I only ate it because I was hungry.

Be sure to check the bill at the end. Instead of charging us for two glasses of wine, they charged us for two bottles.

Rising Sons Brewery,Cork,"Cornmarket St, Centre, Cork, T12 WK27, Ireland",Brewery,4.5,,,,,"Review 1: 1 star - A Surprising Experience at Rising Sons Brewery

I‚Äôve always enjoyed visiting Rising Sons Brewery‚Äîwhether after work or on the weekends, it had become a bit of a regular spot for me. The bar staff have always been incredibly friendly and welcoming. I even gifted them a framed present once as a small thank-you for their hospitality, and I've always been polite and respectful in return.

On one of my recent visits, I was there with two friends to say goodbye to someone moving back to Spain. We were sitting outside enjoying the sun and I recorded a short video from outside to remember the moment. Everything seemed fine, and it was, at the time.

A few days later, I stopped by again after shopping to unwind with a pint and meet a friend. I had my first drink and was about to order a second when I was told‚Äîrather unexpectedly‚Äîthat I was barred. I was quite taken aback, especially since no explanation was given. I was simply told that I‚Äôd need to speak to the manager, who would be in at 6pm.

What surprised me most is that there was no clear reason offered, and up until that moment, I‚Äôd never had a negative interaction with anyone there. The team has always been great, so I can only assume this decision came from management. If the video I took from outside was the issue, I find that a bit confusing, as there was nothing inappropriate or disruptive about it.

In the end, while it‚Äôs disappointing, there are plenty of other great places in Cork to relax and enjoy a drink. I still appreciate the good times I had at Rising Sons, but this experience has left me puzzled. (by Darius) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Great laid-back vibe with a cool industrial feel.

(by Wayne Phair) [a month ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - The food here is delicious filling and affordable. You can get a fresh pizza that would fill two and a pint for ‚Ç¨17 euros. All made fresh by the chef in the open kitchen. This restaurant pub is for all age groups. With a good mixture of people.
I ordered the beef Nachos and the were the best I tasted in a long time.

The portion was definitely made for two. I finished them with some difficulty very fufiling. The seating area is fantastic where you can see the hard work of the chef that goes into making the food from the open kitchen plan.

What a fantastic affordable place to eat excellent pub and restaurant with its own brewery and large selection of own brand pints. Along with all the other well known brands. The decor is fantastic there is also a large screen and plenty of televisions placed around.

The bar staff was patient with my order and had some helpful suggestions. Thanks for that. They also have one of them new card reader tipping station that are becoming popular but also accept cash. If your visiting or a local I highly recommend visiting even just for the experience. A great place for a meal.

I ordered the crumble for dessert as I was still hungry and waited just short of half an hour. That was more like pie filling with biscuit crumbs on top. Not a standard I would expect. I do not make a habit of complaining as you can see from previous reviews but this needed highlighting.

Bocelli Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar,Cork,"1, 2, 3 Maylor St, Centre, Cork, T12 DX23, Ireland",Italian restaurant,4.4,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 5 stars - We had a very good overall experience at this restaurant. There were six of us, and while we were told we needed to wait for our table to be prepared, which took a bit of time, everything after that went smoothly. We placed quite a large order, and all the dishes arrived promptly.

Everything was tasty, and everyone at our table praised their meals. Personally, I feel I didn‚Äôt make the best choice, I ordered salmon, and it was a bit overcooked and slightly tough, and also completely unsalted, which made it less enjoyable for me. However, the side dish that came with it was absolutely delicious.

One of my friends mentioned that her perch was slightly overcooked, but apart from that, everyone else said their food was truly amazing. Considering the number of dishes we ordered, these are really minor remarks.

The desserts were especially praised, we ordered a selection, and my friends were delighted (I didn‚Äôt try them myself, so I can‚Äôt comment firsthand). The coffee was excellent. (by Maryia V.) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - We came here after we couldn't get in somewhere else because we didn't have reservations. I was happy we were able to get in here and even happier after we ate! It was amazing! The pasta was excellent, steak cooked perfectly, and the dessert was to die for! Everything was excellent and the service was great. I thought they were fast, efficient and very attentive. I am so glad we were able to try this little gem! (by Lori K) [a month ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - The food was absolutely fantastic it was like being back in Italy.  Definitely 10/10, the staff were fantastic, we were celebrating an anniversary and they brought out a dessert with a candle such a lovely gesture.  Would highly recommend bocelli's and cant wait to go back. (by Mary Nolan) [2 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - This place was quite the pleasant surprise.  The food is high quality and the service was over the top. We were quite needy and had many requests (such as switching tables from outside to inside when it got too cold) and the servers met every need with a great attitude. Everyone enjoyed their meal. If you like well prepared Italian with great service then this is the place. (by Steve Callahan) [4 months ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Place is generally fairly okay, the food is decent;  focaccia was a highlight. However even tho they advertise catering for various dietary needs, staff has no clue about that. Also in the menu items that has no mil as an alergen are being served with Parmesan on top. (by Mateusz Altman) [3 months ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - Good food but smaller portions, good atmosphere and friendly staff.

(by Vjatseslav Sakovits) [2 months ago] | Review 10: 1 star - AVOID! Honestly, this place was so disappointing. First off, the staff completely ignored us on multiple occasions and would walk away even after looking directly at our table. I understand they are busy but having us change tables after already seating us just because they need more seating was terribly rude!

We were hoping the food would make up for it but it didn't! The portion sizes are tiny and the dishes in general are so bland! I got a cream based pasta and there was very little cream. I could literally make the same thing at home. NOT worth 20 euro. Also very inconsistent, some of us who ordered the same thing got it with garnish and cheese on top while others didn't have it at all! The garlic bread is literally just pitta with garlic sauce. We left feeling hungry and disappointed.

Helena's Restaurant,Cork,"Pembroke St, Centre, Cork, Ireland",Modern European restaurant,4.0,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Excellent food, priced accordingly,  but one complaint‚Ä¶ ordered the rack of lamb and very good but too many sauces and mixed flavours. For example, artichoke sauce, ratatouille, pesto, gratin potatoes and gravy. So too many.

Excellent service, and attentive. (by P.L LALSING) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Beautiful restaurant, staff are warm and attentive.

Nice flavours and textures,I liked the desserts but the sandwiches were only ok the combinations I didn‚Äôt love.The tea I wanted they didn‚Äôt even have which I don‚Äôt understand why it was on the menu.

We were also seated below a ledge where other diners were above us it felt very cramped and the table was so tiny the tier had to be on its own little mini table beside.

Overall cute concept but too cramped. (by Jade Kavanagh) [a year ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - My fiance and I went to Sketch to celebrate his birthday. The server (Fernanda) was welcoming and attentive. She made sure to actually ask chef for my wings to be prepared to my liking. I like them extra crispy and cannot eat them when they are fatty in texture (sensory issue of mine)
Our food order:
Soup of the day, wings, sirloin steak. All cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious.
Our drinks order:
Bloom cocktail and Lemon Meringue cocktail. Both were very well made, the lemon meringue could easily do for a dessert.

Food, service and drinks 10/10
Thank you for a lovely experience and we both look forward to returning soon. (by Rita) [a year ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Amazing location and very good food. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Very pretty decor and a tiny birdcage on every table hosted different types of breakfast breads, jams and fruit cups.  Besides that, you receive a hot food menu made to order. (by MC) [3 years ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - 5 Star afternoon tea.   I'm a bit allergic to these Afternoon Teas as they can be very hit and miss, however the offering at 'Sketch' was definitely a five star HIT.    Professionally looked after by Anais (spelling?) who seated us at very comfortable seats by the window.   We were then treated to a selection of very fine savouries, pastries, tea, coffee, and our package included a cocktail.   The attention to detail was outstanding from the chef and I'd say, one of the best Afternoon Teas we've had to date.
There was a lot of food and Anais packed our leftovers in a very posh doggy bag to enjoy at home - and we did.     A very special treat - BOOK IT.    BTW.   The hotel needs 24 hour notice for Afternoon Tea. (by bryan conlon) [2 years ago] | Review 8: 3 stars - Fish and chips on the lunch menu wasn‚Äôt good especially it 19 euro and 4 star hotel. You can have better fish and chips in another local bar.  The fish didn‚Äôt fresh and a bit over fried.

Look forward to visiting again soon üôÇ (by Emma Cotter) [2 months ago] | Review 4: 1 star - Extremely disappointing experience.
We had booked a table in advance hoping for faster service, but despite arriving 10 minutes early, we waited over 40 minutes for our food.

I ordered a steak, which was absolutely terrible, easily the worst I‚Äôve ever had. I asked for medium rare and got an overcooked, chewy, old piece of meat that was completely misdescribed. It wasn‚Äôt even the right cut to be called a steak. One bite and I genuinely felt like vomiting.

To top it off, we asked for two Coke Zeros during the meal. They never arrived until after we finished eating, only when a waiter came to check in, and we reminded him, he started writing so it seems the other waiter didn‚Äôt even take the order. No apology, no urgency, nothing.

On top of all, so overpriced, we paid 90‚Ç¨ for a fake steak (not) and a fajita chicken with guacamole starter. I‚Äôm so so angry üò§ I paid this much for the worst food and service.

I‚Äôm leaving this place hungry, frustrated, and disgusted. Not only would I never come back, I genuinely wish we never came at all.

Great spot to meet up and start the night. (by Seongkoo Lee) [3 months ago] | Review 9: 4 stars - As a Guatemalan I‚Äôve always loved the set up of the restaurant, the atmosphere and the friendly staff. The restaurant really has that Latin feel to it.

2 mains and a shared dessert were ordered, not long after the main was served there was a rush of people arriving so service a little slower for drinks but definitely forgivable. The 2 mains, FAJITAS de VERDURAS and the GRILLED SKIRT STEAK TAMPIQUE√ëA (picture attached) were delicious and highly recommended.

The Pineapple Cup to share for dessert was unfortunately a bit disappointing.
Instead of watermelon there was cucumber, confirmed by vision, texture and smell.
I‚Äôm pretty sure, instead of patron, there was chilli powder as there was, visually, a red powder which gathered more towards the bottom of the cup along that spicy sensation on the tongue which got more intense the more that was consumed as, like I said, the powder gathered more towards the bottom of the cup.
There is as no alcoholic taste or vapour after taste of alcohol.
The mango, pineapple and strawberries were delicious though but if customers are not going to get exactly what they ordered they should at the very least be notified along with the option of selecting another dessert or else the dish should be taken off the menu for the days service and an attempted cover up not attempted.
Another dessert would have been ordered with absolutely no issue.

I still highly recommend and will be returning but with senses on high alert for any more attempted cover ups. (by Daniel Gannon) [6 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Had heard so much hype about this place and decided to visit here on my wife‚Äôs birthday. The hype was real.

So here's a review from someone who has been there on more than a few occasions.

The Long Valley is a great pub. The staff are quick and attentive. The pints are top class. The atmosphere, especially when a match is on, is great. And their toasties and chips can cure any hangover.

The menu on the website is older, prices are 20% higher. We waited for around 10 minutes to have our order taken, it was quite full. The food was not authentic Japanese , rice was not the proper one, the ramen soup did not have the strong taste and consistency of bone broth. The yakitori and the beef gyuniku were delicious.

The Age Gyoza was very well cooked and seasoned. It tasted very well with the tartar sauce. It also was not very greasy, which was the best of that appetizer.
Sincere gratitude to the amazing, skilled cooks for that!
The staff was very kind and respectful, they even offer green tea from time to time, which is definitely foreign to me until now.

(by Sophie O'Keeffe) [2 years ago] | Review 8: 3 stars - So-so breakfast. The interior is actually nice and shows some effort. The staff is nice, service quick enough. Now, the sausages and the black/white pudding were of seriously good quality, think of Blackrock Castle. Unfortunately the toast was, we'll, over toasted and black on one side. The bacon also fried too long, hard and dry. On the other hand the fried egg was sitting somewhere and arrived cold. The coffee was basic. Won't go here again considering there are much better places. But there's worse, as well. (by Sascha Giese) [6 years ago] | Review 9: 1 star - SEND MANAGER ON A CUSTOMER TRAINING COURSE.

Malay Kitchen Cork City,Cork,"4&5 Paradise Pl, S Main St, Centre, Cork, Ireland",Malaysian restaurant,4.5,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 4 stars - Tucked away in Cork City, Malay Kitchen delivers bold, authentic flavours with a warm welcome to match. The Nasi and Mee Goreng were standouts ‚Äî rich in spice, cooked to order, and packed with that unmistakable wok hei. Portions were generous, and prices felt more than reasonable for the quality. Service was a real highlight: friendly, attentive, and genuinely inviting.

Just a heads-up for dine-in ‚Äî seating is minimal, with bar-style stools and space for only six, so it‚Äôs more of a quick bite than a long sit-down. The only slight letdown was the Mee Goreng sauce, which was a bit heavy and made the noodles softer than expected. Still, a great spot that punches well above its size, and we‚Äôll definitely be back to explore more of the menu.

(by Sabrina Mohammed) [a month ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Have fond memories of Malay kitchen so was delighted to be back as the opening times aren't great when we're around in Cork city.

Got the pad Thai and garlic & fried rice for lunch and it was delightful. Gutted that they no longer offer their Khao Pad but delighted to still see Malay Kitchen in Cork city. Do miss their lunch specials which was rampant around Cork before, understandable given the cost of living crisis but visit was bittersweet.

Dining/sit down area is smaller (bar seating) and they don't have 'free water' station anymore.
Great if you're into spicy food.
Staff was lovely and thorough, hard to understand sometimes but it's all good. Would visit again if we find ourselves in the city and if they're open.

The food was great. The wings fell off the bone and had a great flavor. My wife's chicken sandwich was great and the garlic cheese fries were weirdly great! Service was also on point.

At first I was bummed because I wanted the chicken & waffle I saw on the menu pictured here (it was dated, though). I thought about skipping to eat somewhere else but one of the staff said they instead do fried chicken & French toast so I had to try it.

It‚Äôs absolutely INCREDIBLE. The French toast is almost like a kouign-amann or croissant bun and the fried chicken is the absolute best I‚Äôve ever had. Wild that that‚Äôs true of Ireland :)

The chicken was perfectly spicy, perfectly cooked, and stayed crunchy but juicy the entire meal. Blown away. I also got an iced dirty chia and it was really good. I find the seating a bit uncomfortable but manageable (even as a large person).

Dock 84 Donegal,Donegal,"Main St, Donegal, Ireland",Restaurant,4.6,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 1 star - My worst experience ever. We seen Dock 84 on Sunday the 28th of September and decided we would try it for breakfast as we were hungry. We came in and got seated straight away and it didn‚Äôt take long for someone to take our order. We ordered a full fry and breakfast bap with chips on the side tea and a jug of water. The waitress told us they could only do bottled water which was ok, she brought sparking water instead of still which we could deal with. Then our breakfast came out and they forgot the chips which again we could deal with not that big of an issue‚Ä¶ however I started to eat my fry and noticed a hair on my egg after further inspection we had noticed the fry was full of hair ! We were disgusted by this and just wanted to leave we went up to let our waitress know of the issue and she said ‚Äúcan I see it‚Äù the evidence was left on a tissue and there was still more on the breakfast itself. She took the fry off the bill but still charged for the rest. Personally from working as a waitress myself I believe we shouldn‚Äôt have been charged at all the breakfast bap was barely ate as-well the entire experience was just horrible and I felt sick all day. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone and I certainly won‚Äôt be back myself! (by Anastasija O Reilly) [6 days ago] | Review 2: 3 stars - Had vegetarian breakfast here. It was delicious.

(by Anthony D) [3 weeks ago] | Review 6: 1 star - I agree with many other reviews here, terrible food. So much wrong with this ‚Äúburrito‚Äù.

The rice was not cooked properly and was hard. The beans were not cooked properly and were really hard. The sour cream was as thick as Greek yogurt. The cheese was either frozen or some bizarre rock hard variety that doesn‚Äôt melt. The whole thing was not very hot despite being eaten immediately.  The server tried to put lettuce on before cheese (what on earth?) meaning the cheese didn‚Äôt even soften in the slightly. Every component was basically undercooked and cold.

I see some reviews saying this is ‚Äòexcellent‚Äô like chipotle or tortilla, have those people ever eaten at those brands? This is nothing like those brands, they serve actual burritos; this place does not serve burritos or Mexican food. It is wrong to call this a burrito. It would be insulting and even borderline cultural appropriation to call these products burritos. Have the owners or the people leaving five star reviews ever eaten an actual burrito before? It doesn‚Äôt seem like it. This place serves horrible undercooked Irish wraps.

Only issue with the place is that  the menu boards showing the 4 stages of selection.....type of wrap, main filling, sauce etc are placed in the wrong order so stages are 4,3,2,1. This will make it awkward when it is busy (by Gary Spencer) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Splendid Mexican food location. Similar to Chipotle‚Äôs or Fuzzy Tacos in US, Burrito Loco has the most authentic Tex-Mex food we‚Äôve found in all of Donegal, Northern Ireland, and UK.

(by Carel van Niekerk) [6 years ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Growing up in the area I never ate at the Salmon Inn unless it was part of our football team after a match for soup and sandwiches or maybe a burger but nothing special. As an adult gone from the area for over 20 years I decided to bring my parents there for dinner. Working in the hospitality industry myself and having gone to college for it I can be very critical if things aren't acceptable. Now I wasn't expecting anything 5 üåü from this place regardless of what reviews say but boy was I surprised. The fish cakes were awesome to start with. They were breaded on the outside but full of seafood inside not breading and other stuffing and a good size. The Lamb chops were a decent size also and more than I've seen my old father eat in years but he polished his plate. The stuffed sole I had myself was better than any I've had anywhere across the globe. Our waitress Denise was awesome also. Yes the Salmon Inn deserves a 5Star rating. Only downside is the kitchen is only open on the weekends in winter and still closed on Mondays and Tuesdays in summer. Only thing could have made my experience a little better would have been better weather. Spectacular view on a nice day.

We were seated on arrival without a booking which was good but unfortunately that was the best bit of our visit.

We had our drinks order taken and waited that long to get it that the ice had melted, the Barman had left them on the counter for the floor staff to take them over while he chatted away and the floor girl was flat out busy serving, this was the theme the whole time we were there!

It took them 40 mins to take our food order and then said we had come in behind a big table (of 7) and that was the delay, but that was just taking our order, then our food arrived about 35 mins later and was very disappointing, 2 of us had ordered the chicken Maryland and neither of us could cut through the chicken and the salad on the plate was not worth mentioning (see the picture, that‚Äôs what actually arrived).

This was a long wait for everything and unfortunately not worth the wait, the Barman needs to help out more and not just ‚Äúlook‚Äù busy, instead of chatting to people at the bar (he wasn‚Äôt serving, just chatting) he could serve drinks to tables etc, I wanted to help that girl on the floor she was so busy and he just watched her !!

Then another waitress arrived and could see quite a number of tables waiting on drinks and dinners, people looking despairingly at when their dinner will arrive, some people who came in after us were served food and drinks before us but they kept blaming this big table before us!!

In a nutshell it is a shame because it is a lovely place, the atmosphere is nice, just an awful shame about the service, we were offered free ice cream with desert but we weren‚Äôt staying any longer so did not have desert !!

Such a shame but we won‚Äôt be going back again ! (by Gillian Weir) [3 years ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Casadh an tS√∫g√°in is 5 star and more! We stopped off on our way back to killybegs.

There is clearly a lot of pride taken in this setup and if you want a great pizza in the Letterkenny area you have to add this to your list!

Stone fired authentic Neapolitan Pizza and well priced, ‚Ç¨22 for two at the time of writing.

Really tasty. (by TomBoyNI) [Edited 2 years ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - The perfect pizzas! Really delicious and fresh pizzas, so tasty! The garlic pizza is amazing also! Looking forward to getting their pizzas again soon! (by Aoife) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - I‚Äôve been to both locations of Napoli Express: Letterkenny and Donegal Town. There‚Äôs consistency, taste and quality in delivery across both. Prices are reasonable and pizzas simple and tasty as they should be, the true Napolitan style. If you are a fan of sauces and plenty of stuff on a pizza, this might not be for you.

These are proper Italian style, thin crust pizzas, with just couple quality ingredients, made in 400 Celsius oven similar to wood fired ones, but I believe these are gas powered for technical and safety reasons.

Pizzas cost about ‚Ç¨12-13 and if you take two it is ‚Ç¨22 deal, and if you get three it is ‚Ç¨33 + same size garlic bread which kind of feels like a fourth pizza to some extent.

Lovely guys and amazing street vans with quality of a solid restaurant. Highly recommend! (by Maciej Badowski (bluntforcehealing.com)) [a year ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - The best pizza I ever had!! It was delicious! All fresh ingredients.

Upon our arrival, we were fortunate to secure a table immediately. Our group ordered a variety of dishes including four fish tacos (two with regular sauce and two without sauce), two prawn bao buns, the flavorful Gambas, crispy battered cod pieces with skinny fries for the little one and the prawn dumplings (3 pieces).

The food at Fisk was nothing short of exceptional, with each dish seasoned to perfection and ingredients bursting with flavors. We were thoroughly impressed and couldn't find a single fault in any of our meals. The staff further elevated our dining experience with their warm and friendly service, going above and beyond to recommend their best-selling dishes when we had trouble deciding.

Our memorable meal at Fisk came to around 75 euros, a fair price considering the quality of the food and service we received.

Drove out from Letterkenny for lunch & there was already a small queue before they opened. There‚Äôs only five tables inside, but food can be eaten outside, and I also believe it can be brought into the bar.

We ordered three oysters, one fish taco, and the mussels.

Oysters we‚Äôre some of the best I‚Äôve ever had, served with a chili granita. So creamy and no grittiness.
My dad was tempted by the prawn bao, but opted for the fish taco, & said it was a winner. Perfectly cooked battered fish, slaw, spicy mayo & pico de gallo.
Mussels came in a tomatoey sauce, along with a portion of perfect chips.
Unfortunately I was only allowed a small sample before dad reminded me that it was his lunch, not mine.

Only wine is served in Fisk, but soft drinks, beer etc can be bought in the bar and brought in.

One americano to finish, and our bill came to ‚Ç¨28.00.

Highly recommend. (by Aidan Fitzsimons) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Had one of the most tasty and lovely dinners in Ireland, the atmosphere and service were fantastic.

I had the monkfish which was served in a wonderful sauce and the fondant for dessert which was delicious!! We will definitely be returning here. The only available parking is on the Main Street which is metered during the day. The owner is the chef which makes this place extra special. They use locally sourced produce, meat from convoy and fish from Killybegs. (by Amanda Gallagher) [6 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Food and service was amazing.  I let Brian know in advance it was our anniversary and he made our evening special.  Best food in whole of Donegal and definitely in my top 5 meals that I've ever had.

Complementary bread with fresh butter with rock salt is a must try. Has an intimate sitting design so will be good for a date night out. (by Megas XLR) [a month ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - I had a lovely meal in No.9. The quality and presentation of the food is top class. There is a nice atmosphere and decor in the restaurant. On our visit the chef made an appearance to check if we were happy with  everything. The only thing to note is that the restaurant is located on the first floor and I didn't see a lift, so anyone with mobility issues might need to enquire about that when booking. (by Fergal O'Mahony) [3 weeks ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - We were a party of 8 and all felt this was an exceptional restaurant.   Brian the chef/owner was so welcoming on arrival and we ate most of the menu across the group with the chowder starter and monkfish main being among the stars. Delightful team serving and good value compared to other dinners on our trip. (by Alex Nixon) [a month ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Fabulous dinner 10 out of 10. The Goat cheese salad was amazing, the monkfish was outstanding and dessert was the perfect end to a wonderful meal. Chief Brian you knocked it out of the park ‚Ä¶.

This pub is one of the best (by D Murphy) [Edited 2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - At this restaurant, dining transcends into an art form, where each dish is a masterpiece meticulously crafted to tantalize the senses. The culinary experience here is nothing short of extraordinary, with every bite offering a symphony of flavors that dance harmoniously on the palate.

Happy to hear they won another award because they totally deserve it. It's an experience with interesting flavour combinations and beautiful presentation. The kitchen is open and you can see how they prep your food. Staff is really nice and not that pushy nice coming twice each course asking how's your food when your mouth is stuffed üòÇ
Is it pricey? Both yes (for local standards) and no (if you compare same level restaurants). But it's totally worth it and I would be happy to go back in summer when they have different menu.
Only thing: if your main is not hot let them know, mine was at room temperature, still tasty, but sure it would be better hot. Wasn't sure if that was intended or not, but server said all main dishes should have been hot.

The restaurant is a story on its own! Polite, friendly and patient staff. Comfortable atmosphere. The meals are unbelievable, bursting with flavors that are combined in different genius ways.

Attached to a traditional bar is the almost hidden gem of a restaurant which can rival the best. From moment I arrived with a friends a warm welcome. Our servers Ashleen, Maja and Annie not only gave a great welcome but can with great knowledge guide you through the options on a set menu. The starters are all to die for, despite the huge temptation of fresh local fish I took Pork and Pork Belly as main - best I have ever had. Around the table a Black Sole, Lamb and a Curry all got huge thumbs up. Watch your appetite we struggled with a very tasty cheese plate. Top of my agenda for next trip to Donegal.

The views are absolutely stunning, our room was beautiful, and the food was excellent. We were kindly upgraded to the Donegal Suite, which made the stay even more special.

We also had the Relax and Recharge Spa treatment ‚Äî and it was beyond good, such a perfect way to unwind.

For dinner, we went to the Gallery Bar ‚Äî the Apple Virgin Mojito mocktail was refreshing, and the Sirloin steak was delicious.

This was our last night before going back to Dublin and it was such an amazing and special experience. This hotel is just as beautiful as it looks in the pictures, and it's in the most beautiful location. I especially need to commend the housekeeping staff. I left some personal items and when I called a few days later, they arranged for it to be shipped to my home address and smoothly handled the situation. They were attentive and communicative and really went above and beyond. I definitely recommend a stay here! (by Emi Montenegro) | Review 7: None - It's a pretty castle when you drive up, but most of the hotel building was constructed in the 2000's. They charge a hefty price and are lacking in cleanliness and service. We dined in both restaurants and each evening we felt the food was just ok. We were very disappointed with the crab appetizer which had a cat food like mushed up texture and tasted like canned crab, not fresh. The rooms and hallways needed a bit more dusting, especially around light fixtures, and some hallways and stairwells needed new carpeting. Overall, this was one of the more expensive hotels we stayed in and it was our least enjoyable stay.

(1) Our reservation was not found, under a different person's name, caused confusion upon arrival.
(2) Missing TV remote that took 3 hours to replace and 3 trips to the front desk to ask.
(3) Cleanliness: peanuts found on carpet, hairs on shower wall and towels that were ""damp"".
(4) Hot water is lukewarm at best.

The ""Castle"" is beautiful from the outside and upon entering.  But rooms are in a different part, very modern and large.  Certainly didn't give the feel of a ""castle"" stay, just a fancy hotel.

Very isolated with no food options other than hotel within walking distance and very pricey.

Gardens and sculptures are pretty but some were hidden due to overgrowth of plants.

Highlights included:
Solid internet.
Coffee, tea, water & snacks in room.
Large, comfy bed
A/C (by The Wanderers) | Review 10: None - This is by far the nicest place I‚Äôve ever stayed. We had a beautiful suite, the grounds were breath taking and all the food met the same high standards.

Next time i go i just want to allot more time to use the spectacular amenities like the spa and pool. However, we did get to use the gym and the bikes and that was a treat.

Dinner was so fun and Johnny kept us laughing and had great recommendations. Breakfast was probably my favorite of any that we had in Ireland and i was even able to have an oatmilk latte with that.

Myself, my partner & 2 kids visited at 1pm on a Wednesday. I ordered nachos, my partner ordered loaded fries and then we just ordered 2 portion of chips for the kids. It was an hour wait, I completely understand that food is made fresh & takes time but it was just chips & a bowl of nachos? One of my kids actually fell asleep we were waiting so long. When my nachos arrived they were covered in guacamole which wasn‚Äôt stated on the menu, they also came burnt black, they were not edible. When it came to pay, I said to the girl at the til (who also served us) that I was happy to pay for everything except the nachos, she got an attitude and was quite rude, she said I should have it before now but after waiting an hour already I wasn‚Äôt going to ask for them to be changed, I didn‚Äôt eat them and she seen that as she cleared our table. She told me she didn‚Äôt know what to do, I was extremely polite and said I‚Äôd pay for everything else but not the nachos, I wasn‚Äôt paying ‚Ç¨13 for something that was burnt and not as advertised. A manger then came and took the nachos off the bill but she completely ignored me, no apology or anything. Just not good service.
On a positive note their milkshakes were lovely, chips also nice. Just a long wait and poor service Upon paying.

Waiting for the table was not an issue for me as I was there more for the vibe than for drinks. The place had its own vibe as there was screening of a football match on that day. Everybody enjoyed the match and it was full of emotional and exciting rollercoasters as people were cheering for their favorite team and would get angry with every miss of goal. The service here was super quick and staff was very welcoming. They would even ask you if you want to repeat the order if they notice empty glass or empty plates on the table. The food was also quite on time and I didn't have to wait much for it even though the place had so many orders going on continuously.

You will also have a excellent view of the sea right opposite to it.
We went in on a Sunday and it still managed to attract a good number of of customers as soon as the restaurant was open.
It has also got a few parking spots available. We loved our overall experience there and we would definitely recommend them.

We were kindly greeted by a member of staff and shown to our table. The menu has a lot to offer and has something for everyone. I had the vegetable soup ,curry chips and onion rings and the rest the gang had seafood dishes.
We could not have been better looked after, the service is great and and the food was stunning.
Well done everyone at the Marina and thanks so much.üôåüèº (by Jayoforshow) [4 weeks ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Talented and experienced Head Chef running excellent service with a delicious menu, it is a must for a food if visiting Killybegs. (by A. Campas) [a month ago] | Review 8: 4 stars - food is good, probably could do with a few more options on the menu, chowder was ok a wee bit on the watery side, coffee is good and the oysters were very nice but expensive probably the nicest ones I've tasted (by paul) [2 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - I was craving a big, juicy, fully-loaded burger after a weekend of camping and hiking and theirs hit the spot, with chips that were hot, fresh and delicious. My partner had the chowder and said it was flavourful and stuffed with seafood. The brown bread is the best I‚Äôve ever tasted (a secret recipe, alas‚ÄîI would love to know how to make brown bread like that). The place is very busy (always a good sign), but the service was attentive and friendly and the food was quick to arrive.  The ice cream cone on our way out the door was the perfect dessert to crown the experience. Mad props to everyone running this place! It will have my recommendation to anyone visiting Killybegs, and I hope we‚Äôre able to get back soon. (by Courtney Knudsen) [2 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Place don't take bookings, so you have to show up at the door, hoping to find small queue. We did and got lucky. The restaurant is very informal. But clean and no smell of fish (even if the fry quite a lot). Service is very friendly but with attention to details and also care for customers.

Lovely welcome/greeting from busy but accommodating staff.  4 lunch specials were offered in addition to the menu in this smallish bistro!  I ordered the carbonara pasta and asked for a side Caesar salad which was no problem even though not available on the menu as a side.  Hubby ordered the special chicken curry.  Both were delicious!

From the chairs to the seats to blanket with holes cut in it for lights.  No music, just noise of loud people.

The staff were friendly and accommodating service was very prompt.
The food was outstanding. They offered some complimentary starters a stunning ratatouille mouse, some fresh bread and the most amazing butter I've ever tried.

Absolutely loved it and would highly recommend it for a lovely evening.
We will definitely be back (by Monica Toland) [a month ago] | Review 2: 2 stars - I came in with very high expectations given the Michelin reccomendation and the glowing reviews from so many people. Unfortunately, the experience fell far short and left us feeling disappointed.

The service was stretched and at times we had to wait 2 to 3 minutes just to get attention for something as basic as cutlery or another drink. Not what you would expect at this level.

For starters we had the scallops and the beetroot salad. Both were nice, with the salad standing out more, but the real disappointment of the evening was the slow cooked beef. My wife and I are big beef lovers and this was almost inedible. It was so gamy and unpleasantly strong in flavor that after our first bite we both had the same reaction. We called the server and politely asked if we could change it for something else, but were refused and told, ‚ÄúThis is how beef cheek is supposed to taste, most people don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù (The chef said the same when two full plates were sent back with a bite taken out of each)

If that is the case, it would have been very helpful if this had been mentioned on the menu or explained by the staff before ordering. At this standard we would have at least expected either an option to change the dish or to have it taken off the bill. Instead we were left with a main course we could not eat and a chef who didnt think that our opinion mattered which really ruined the meal for us

The finer details were also missing such as missing screws on the bathroom door handle, empty hand wash, and single use paper napkins on the tables. Small things, but in a Michelin starred restaurant they really stand out.

We finished with the sticky toffee pudding which was fine, but by that point the whole experience felt underwhelming.

Overall we expected so much more. A Michelin star comes with the promise of exceptional service, food, and attention to detail, and sadly this just did not deliver. (by Huzaifa Saeed) [2 weeks ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Can‚Äôt fault anything. Absolutely stunning!

We wanted to try bit of everything so asked the staff if it‚Äôs ok to order bunch of nibbles and starters instead of having main dish each.
There was no issue at all and staff was happy to accommodate us with this.

Definitely coming back here again.

We made detour to come here but no regrets and happy belly leaving the restaurant.

The Boathouse Bar/Restaurant,Donegal,"Tullynavinn, Redcastle, Co. Donegal, Ireland",Restaurant,4.6,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Enjoyed a lovely meal here at the Boathouse. Ordered the fish of the day which was cod with some mussels and potatoes as well as an extra side that came with it. Creamy sauce worked very well with the mussels and easily one of the best I've had, cod was cooked beautifully and had a crispy skin but also retained a firm flakiness to the flesh. You are treated to a fantastic view as well while being taken care of by an attentive staff. (by Will Wong) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Amazing place, with breathtaking views and super friendly staff. One small jewel in the WAW with views to the bay and Northern Ireland, great parking space and super nice people serving the 100 of us that came with the bikes and vehicles.

Thanks very much for feeding us during our charity cycle supporting LauraLynn!!

The food was truly exceptional, far surpassing the standard of other restaurants in the area. Every dish was crafted to perfection, with vibrant flavors and top-quality ingredients. It was clear that meticulous attention to detail was placed in both the presentation and taste. A truly memorable dining experience that we can‚Äôt wait to repeat. Highly recommended!

The restaurant itself has a lovely, warm and inviting atmosphere which is topped off with the best food in donegal that I have tried to date. It is not overly expensive and you get a good portion. Overall I will continue to dine here because it sets a very high standard,  one some of the more expensive places close could learn from.

Food and service both really good, so good in fact that we visited a second time a couple of days later. Definitely recommend a visit here.

The restaurant was packed but our food came out so fast we were shocked because we knew it was busy and expected a delay.
The food was as good of food that I've ate in donegal ,credit to the chefs, highly recommended coming here and well done for your good work üëè (by Shaun Boyce) [Edited a month ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - The girls and I visited The Ubiquitous Restaurant Buncrana on the busy May bank holiday, and it was an absolutely fab experience from start to finish.  Despite being quite busy, the atmosphere was great, had an amazing buzz, and the staff couldn‚Äôt have been better, they were very attentive, friendly, and super welcoming.

The food was to die for, very well done, really good quality, generous portions, plus such good value for money. The cocktails were easily the best I‚Äôve had in town.

Really excited to go back for literally any occasion I can‚Äîhighly recommended! (by Eimear Brennan) [4 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Was visiting Buncrana with family and went here for dinner.

(by Paula Harte) [a month ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - My husband & I were desperately looking for somewhere to eat in Buncrana that allowed dogs in. We had absolutely no luck whatsoever, so my husband decided to go into Ubiquitous & ask the owner if there was any way they would accommodate the 3 of us. We were delighted that he agreed and we had a first class meal. I had a duck dish which was absolutely gorgeous, as were all the trimmings. My husband's sea bream was equally delicious and both meals were beautifully presented.  The service was very good and staff were very friendly and efficient. We would highly recommend this restaurant if you want an excellent meal at a reasonable price.  We will definitely return should we be in Buncrana again. (by G Wilkinson) [4 weeks ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Came in with a very large group with not booking. At the time we were told there was no tables available but if we went to the bar next door for half an hour someone would be in to get us and in fairness they were. Hid loved the waitress taking our order because we were well on at this point but the service was top notch and the food was just as good. Very professional very good food at a reasonable price. Couldn‚Äôt knock it (by O C) [4 weeks ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Went here with the kids yesterday and again today. We had all planned to have exactly what we had the first day as the food was so good(kids had the Ubiquitous Fries and we had the chowder and the smash burger). BUT, when we went back and they had a roast beef dinner on the menu, so we forgot about the burgers and chowder and went for the roast - it was one of the best roast beef‚Äôs we have ever had!!! Genuinely standout food! We are still on holidays in Buncranna and will definitely go again this week‚Ä¶

Update: we went back for our third visit in 5 days! Once again, the food and service were exceptional. This really is a great place for lunch or dinner or cocktails!

The Restaurant at Harvey's Point,Donegal,"Friary, Lough Eske, Co. Donegal, F94 E771, Ireland",Restaurant,4.7,,,,,"Review 1: 4 stars - Lovely staff and wonderful food! They had great options for both vegetarian and vegan on their evening dinner menu. The standard of the food was excellent. I think it'd be even better for lunch when you can enjoy the views. Will definitely be back!

Updated review: Went back for lunch - views were spectacular. Had to drop to a 4 star based on the lunch food. I'm not sure if it was a different chef, the food was still nice, but nothing like the dinner experience. See the added photo of the sea bass from lunch, quite overdone, although the potatos & vegetables were lovely. The stuffed Mediterranean vegetables were nice, but nothing special. We were the first customers from the lunchtime menu, so not really sure what happened. We will definitely go back for dinner, but not for the lunch, unfortunately. Lunchtime staff were as lovely as the evening staff though, but the food let it down. (by Louise Mc) [Edited 2 years ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Absolutely wonderful dinner on Saturday the 15th!

The team‚Äôs hospitality was exceptional, ensuring a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Overall, our dinner was thoroughly enjoyable, and we highly recommend this establishment for a satisfying meal. (by Rosemary) [a year ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Sunday lunch was amazing. Food was 10/10 ! Unfortunately, that day there were also 2-3 big birthdays on. Which is fine... but our small table of two did get completely  forgotten about. Only got one drinks order, and that was with  the soup. Had too go to the bar every round, and i got fed up after the 3rd round and didn't buy any more ( I would love to have 3-4 more cocktails each)

Starters weren't cleared either, so we were nearly finished with our mains by the time the starters were cleared. Talking 20 minutes minimum on a crammed tiny table with dishes everywhere.

Not the service, I remember, but we still had a great time, and the food was great, hence the 4 star review.

13euro a cocktail, and I have to get up and go stand at the bar?!

Madness.

Certainly, I shouldn't have tipped, but I did anyway.

I hope that when we return for Christmas dinner, we don't get forgotten about again. We will be very unhappy.

What made the experience so great were the unique flavors of each dish and how well it all came together. The prawns were cooked to perfection and actually tasted sweet. The Roosterkoek was very interesting, a bread that‚Äôs cooked by being grilled and tasted smoky. The beef bitterballens were basically pulled beef balls that were deep fried and so delicious and creamy. For mains, we got the short rib and one of the specials for the night, the T-bone steak.  The steak was juicy and the short rib has got to be the best one I‚Äôve ever had from any place. For dessert we got the malva pudding and chocolate brownie. Again, we were very surprised by the pudding and felt that it was the best of the two. We‚Äôll be back again for sure.

Logues of Cranford,Donegal,"Cranford, Co. Donegal, F92 K202, Ireland",Restaurant,4.6,,,,,"Review 1: 1 star - Food was well below par, we were served Roast Beef that was dry and grizzly. Vegetables and Potatoes had zero taste and it was obvious they were sitting out for a long time. Would not return unfortunately. The girls serving did their best. (by Dave Doyle) [a month ago] | Review 2: 2 stars - Unfortunately not a great experience. The roast beef was very dry, tasted like it had been cooked a couple of days before. The sides of vegetables were tasteless.

For some reason, one of the chicken goujons on the kid's wrap was pink inside, but the other two were OK.

And the hake goujons were quite rubbery.

I'll acknowledge that the staff were quite attentive, and we did provide feedback on the beef, which they then comped on the bill. Although typically I would have thought that the chef might have come out to ask about it. (by Gary Dooley) [a month ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - First time visiting Logues of Cranford.

Really good pizzas, the ingredients were very good quality, and a nice textured pizza base. We had an excellent dessert too. It's obvious someone's heart has gone into the place, and it's not just some corporate roll out. Decor was cool, in a young lad sort of way.

Also, the owner is a really hotty. I was not sure if he kept dropping mozzarella on purpose or was he doing that to stimulate the experience of the customer but it sure did spice up our evening. Let‚Äôs just say at he is zealous with the pepperoni. (by Aidan Killian) [3 years ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Fabulous food, lovely staff. Lovely experience overall.

Took over 2 hours from start to finish just to get 2 main courses for 2 people. Never again! RESPONSE TO OWNER: You never replied to my review....quite strange that you think you did!

McCafferty's Bar & Restaurant,Donegal,"Lower Main St, Meenmore, Dungloe, Co. Donegal, Ireland",Bar & grill,4.6,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 4 stars - Very nice ,local traditional bar, nicely decorated with old pictures of famous irish people. The staff were very welcoming and helpful, and the service was prompt. It was a very busy evening but still got accommodated with a table fairly quickly.  A good bustling atmosphere throughout the pub. Several TVs covered the various sporting events. The food itself was a little underwhelming. I ordered the ceasar salad, which was very nice, but the sauce was not the traditional ceasar sauce,maybe a variant or a 1000 island dressing or something similar. The chicken was nice and the salad fresh and well presented. Can't recall any cheese sprinkled on the salad. The children's pasta dish was nice but a bit shy on the pasta sauce, so it was a little dry, nice but a little dry. The chicken curry was very nice with lots of flavour. For desert, I got the Orange cheese cake, again not much flavour to it and very, very soft , almost cream like as it fell apart. Overall a very nice pub/restaurant with very nice staff , a girl named Summer served us and was really nice and helpful. The food was nice, and I'm probably being a bit picky with the sauces . All the other dishes that came out looked lovely. (by Andy) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - My family and I recently had a fantastic meal at McCafferty's in Dungloe, and I have to say, it was a truly memorable experience. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the staff were incredibly friendly and attentive.
To start, we decided to share the chilli beef nachos, and what a great decision that was! The portion was generous, piled high with crispy tortilla chips, flavorful chilli beef, and a perfect blend of melted cheese, salsa, and sour cream. It was the ideal dish to kick off our meal, and we all agreed they were some of the best nachos we've had.
For our main courses, we sampled a variety of dishes, and each one was absolutely delicious. The steak sandwich was a standout‚Äîthe steak was cooked to perfection, tender and juicy, nestled in fresh, crusty bread with all the right accompaniments. It was a hearty and incredibly satisfying dish.
The salmon was another highlight, beautifully cooked with a crispy skin and flaky, moist flesh. It was served with a fantastic selection of vegetables that complemented the fish wonderfully. The rest of my family who ordered the chicken gougons were equally impressed. The chicken was tender and coated in a light, crispy batter, making them a delicious and comforting choice.
Honestly, every single dish we ordered was amazing, and to top it all off, we finished the meal with a rich and creamy Oreo milkshake. It was the perfect sweet ending to an already incredible meal. The quality of the food, the generous portions, and the fantastic service made for a perfect evening. McCafferty's is a gem in Dungloe, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a superb dining experience.

Big spacious room with a double and single beds, a small kitchenette and a big bathroom. We were only staying for one night but it would be ideal if you were staying longer in the area.

In the evening we went across the road for food as the kitchen wasn‚Äôt serving but returned to the bar for the evening. Not very busy but busy enough for a week night.

The barman was polite and friendly and we had a nice evening.

Have to say the assorted vegetables served as a side was just amazing!!Our starters and dessert as well were 5/5üëåüèº

Thank you chef! Everything tasted so good, as well as perfectly presented.

Even though the restaurant was busy, the service was on point . The only thing I would say is we wished the restaurant more cozy and intimate considering it‚Äôs a castle hotel but instead felt we were in an extended dinning hall. There were so many rooms within the castle that could be used for dining including the Father Browne bar which I think could be a restaurant instead of a bar, as most guests visit the upstairs bar anyways.

Overall like I said meal was the highlight and was fantasticü§åüèºüëåüèº (by Adweeth S) [a year ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - We ate dinner here one night of our stay at the hotel. The service was great - our waitress was Annie and she was lovely, so helpful. We had the wine pairings with our meal and she was great at explaining them briefly and serving them promptly.

I had the haddock kiev to start which was amazing, followed by hake which was good too. I'm not a dessert person but they were very good here - especially loved the tirami-choux. (by Janine M) [3 years ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Nice spacious restaurant, very polite staff, good choice of food which is very tasty .
On Sundays they have special courses both for adults and kids. The view is towards the hotel's park and it's great on a sunny day.
The only thing I didn't like too much is the back side of the restaurant where there isn't much sunlight coming from the windows due to a wooden library-kind of wall which separates it from the front side.
The car park is in less than a minute Walk from the entrance. They also have an entrance for disabled people. (by A.) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - The most incredible service, excellent staff, amazing food. Beautiful atmosphere. Our large party had been traveling all day, got turned away from the pub, but inquired at Cedars and was immediately welcomed, and the highest quality service given to us even though we were not guests of the hotel and just passing through late in the evening. Did not make us feel uncomfortable, underdressed, or out of place ‚Ä¶ the staff went above and beyond to welcome us and make it a delightful experience! Outstanding food! And the best hospitality - thank you!! (by Lydia Smith) [4 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - First time eating in Cedars Fine Dining restaurant... New summer menu has alot of tasty options and I was so happy with my selection of scallops to start and pork fillet for main and rhubarb souffle to finish. Service was both professional and friendly. Attention to detail was up there with the best without being interfering. Food is rich and portions are well sized! Can't wait to return. Breakfast is also served here and it is of a high standard. Pastries are fresh and delicious. Coffee needs to be a little better, a flat white I ordered came with a large amount of foam, a quick barista course would help make it perfect! (by John Cahalin) [4 years ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - We had an incredible meal at Cedars, we were so well looked after by Adrian, James and the rest of the staff. Amazing food, great service and atmosphere in a beautiful location. Highly recommended! I'm vegan and I've attached a pic of the vegan menu - so great to have so many options to choose from!

Blas,Donegal,"Lough Eske Rd, Mullans, Donegal, Ireland",Bistro,4.8,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 4 stars - Blas is an absolute gem in Donegal Town üåø ‚Äî a place where warm hospitality meets exceptional food. The setting is cosy yet stylish, with a lovely balance of modern touches and rustic charm that makes you want to linger.

The staff are genuinely welcoming and attentive. You can tell they care about both the food and the people they serve.

On my visit, I had the breaded chicken fillet burger üçî ‚Äî perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy and tender chicken fillet , served in a fresh bun with vibrant, well-seasoned chips and side salad. For dessert, I went for the marbled red velvet brownie üç´üç∞, which was rich, indulgent, and beautifully presented ‚Äî the kind of sweet treat you remember long after the last bite.

The relaxed atmosphere make Blas a must-visit. Whether you‚Äôre stopping in for breakfast, lunch, or just coffee and cake ‚òï, you‚Äôll leave feeling well-fed and well-looked-after.

Highly recommended for locals and visitors alike üåü.

I would recommend to pre book the slot for lunch or breakfast even on the weekdays as they are absolutely favorites for the locals.

It also has ample of parking and is wheelchair accessible as well (by ajay harmale) [3 weeks ago] | Review 2: 3 stars - Kind staff.

Our waitress was incredibly attentive. Not only did she take our orders efficiently, but she also remembered that I had asked for soya milk in my drink and thoughtfully checked if I‚Äôd like my porridge made the same way (which I had completely forgotten to mention).

The food was outstanding, and everyone at the table left happy. Most of the portions (especially the porridge, Greek yoghurt, and pancakes) were very generous, while the avocado crush and pan boxty were more standard in size. I highly recommend the matcha latte and the porridge with fresh berries and honey, both were delicious! ü´∂üèªü´∂üèª (by Estrella) [2 months ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - Cute spot for brunch with nice menu options. Note that it only opens at 10am to the public. My friends couldn‚Äôt decide what to get so got the half savoury half sweet option which was a good compromise. There was a slight problem with my omelette, but when I notified the staff they fully nulled the cost of it. I will say I didn‚Äôt feel like we got the warmest welcome, but again once I mentioned the issue with my meal they were very apologetic which I appreciated.

The Lobster Pot,Donegal,"Burtonport, Co. Donegal, F94 HD91, Ireland",Restaurant,4.6,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 5 stars - Food was excellent. Chowder was rich with every spoon full of seafood. The wings were as good as they should be - crispy and covered in a buffalo sauce that had just the right amount of butter. The two mains we got was the rutland sizzler and one of the specials for the night which was the whole Sea bass with roast garlic butter. The steak was great but I have to say the sea bass topped with the roast garlic butter and a squeeze of lemon, tasted incredible. For dessert we got the apple pie which I highly recommend. (by Akram M) [3 weeks ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Fabulous place!! Food is amazing. Holly was the sweetest host. The crab claw and prawn col au vent was EPIC. Proper throw back to my childhood.

The food was lovely, so there were no complaints. The staff were nice and fairly prompt with service. The owner/manager (i assume) was full of chat to all guests and helpful with questions about the food and where it was sourced, etc. I had the spicy wings , which are fairly hot and filling ,with a side of chips. Other meals were the steak baguette, which was very nice ,crab claw and prawns vol au vonts , which im told was very nice. The last dish was Crab claws, which was devoured by my daughter. She said they were gorgeous. Maybe a touch was expensive for 6 small claws, but that's life. All the food was very well presented and very tasty. Overall, there are no complaints at all and very nice food. It was midday, so it was relatively quiet, but by all accounts, it can get very busy.

Danny Minnies Country House,Donegal,,,4.8,,,,,"Review 1: None - Amazing service and food, we had a really good family dinner on our holidays there. The pre dinner drinks in the cozy lounge area by the fire was a lovely touch. We had a lovely table setup and the food arrived in time as we sat down and had our sip of wine. Excellent selection of breads to start with and definitely recommend the lamb, the scallops and the duck liver patte. Definitely recommend.

There was not a bad meal on the table and the entire experience was so amazing!! We will definitely be back and would highly recommend (by Kevin Arenhold) | Review 3: None - I'm giving this a four stars..look the food overall is really great with a few minor niggles...there was an unevenness in portion sizes. I enjoyed a huge wonderfully cooked Turbot fillet ..but my dining pals dishes, though very tasty, were a bit mean sized.. especially the sea trout. While the veg accompaniments were plentiful and also overall tasty, the red cabbage offering was a colorful but bland tasting and added nothing other than a splash of color. The variant dauphinoise were yummy but the young spuds were a tad wet.

The service was welcoming and familiar at the outset as we enjoyed pre dinner drinks in a comfy lounge before dinner..after that the service slipped. We had at least four different people attend our table during the night..with some pros and a few cons...at the end of the evening it would have been nice if one of the staff would be assigned to ensuring a thanks and goodbye...it would be a welcome touch.. after all.. while we found the prices generally reasonable for the quality of food it was not a cheap night out. So overall I would come back for the food but there is a need to tweak and improve on some details , notably on the service front and then this place would truly shine.

I should add, the potentially kitsch faux castle interior somehow works and makes for a cozy and comfortable restaurant setting. Very nice.

With a history dating back to 1911 and a charming collection of antique showpieces, the restaurant offers a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Despite being a busy place, the service was impressively quick and efficient.

The food lived up to its great reputation. We started with Taco Chicken Tenders, which were incredibly crispy and fresh. For the mains, I had the Crispy Italian Chicken, which was packed with flavor‚Äîthe roasted pepper and tomato sauce added a delicious kick to every bite. The portion sizes were generous, making the meal even more satisfying.

The kids‚Äô menu was also impressive, both in portion size and taste. I was pleasantly surprised by the chicken curry with rice, which had the perfect blend of spices‚Äîso good that I couldn‚Äôt resist trying it myself!

To top it all off, we indulged in the cheesecake for dessert, which was absolutely delightful and made our experience even better.

Would recommend! We did NOT have a reservation and walked right in at 6:30 on a Tuesday, but it's not high season yet, either. I recommend booking a table.

Old Stone,Donegal,"unit 2/3 donegal carpark, Donegal, F94 T3PR, Ireland",Restaurant,4.6,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 5 stars - Awesome cafe with great vegetarian options to choose from. Tried the veggie burger and the quinoa salad. Both were amazing. Lots of good options for kids to choose from. Mine tried the waffles and was happy with it mostly due to the maple syrup that came with it. Service is quick and the servers are all smiling which makes you feel welcomed. Finally, seemed like a busy place. We were there at 1pm Saturday and still it was full. We did get the table in a few minutes though. (by Ruchika Kakani) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 2 stars - Kind of disappointed. If the food would have been better, could have overlooked the service. Had the incorrect menu (brunch) for 10 minutes before we were finally able to get the correct one, and it wasn't because they were busy. They handed us the incorrect ones when we arrived. Food was presented nicely, but my ""smash burger"" was not a smash burger. It was a thick, overworked, dense beef patty that was cooked on one side and not flipped. It reminded me of the airport food. Service was 'meh' as well. Came here because of the reviews. (by Ben Taff) [2 weeks ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Enjoyed a lovely breakfast here in Donegal Town in a cosy cafe. We ordered poached egg with avocado and two small old stone breakfasts. Black pudding stood out with a spicy clove flavour to it. Great start to your day! (by Will Wong) [4 weeks ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - My family and I passed through Donegal and decided on this establishment based on the menu selections (proper coffee selections). It's a cute cafe with a great atmosphere located near a car park.

The food was amazing. My husband had the Pecan Belgium Waffle and loved it. It was sweet, but not too sweet. The bacon is more like ham, so if you're from America we want you to have proper expectations. My son had the Vegetable Soup, which he's tried at every restaurant we've stopped along the way. It had a sweet, fresh flavor with little bits of carrots in it. My daughter had the Old Stone Burrito which came with a side if potatoes she absolutely loved. The burrito was done well and paired with a sauce on the side. I had the Cinnamon French Toast. I was thrilled to see it came with proper berry compote. We've had compote at other places in Ireland and it was like canned pie filling. This tasted as if it was just made with my meal. It tasted very good and was light and fluffy. Must be the Irish milk that made the difference. Overall, we would eat here again.

The dirty Chai came as expected in a nice sized cup and truly hit the spot. My daughter had an iced caramel latte and didn't care much for that. I didn't mind it but wouldn't order it again.

The only thing lacking was service. We had to get up from the table to order food, to get more water and for to-go containers. No one came by after dropping food off to see how our meal was. (by Bridgette Stine) [a year ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Very cosy place with delicious food. I got the porridge and it was perfect!

(by Rucha Ambilpure) [8 months ago] | Review 9: 1 star - Was very disappointed on Saturday the 6th of September around 10:30am, anytime I‚Äôve been here before the food was very good. The morning in discussion the service was so disappointing, I walked in with two others, there was three young staff members together behind the counter. We waited a few minutes, understandably as it was busy but when a waitress came over she was not in any way friendly or welcoming, pointing us down to our table instead of walking us to the table. We then waited longer than expected to get menus or an offer of giving a drink order while we waited. Eventually a different member of staff put a bunch of menus on the table without saying a word, we didn‚Äôt even have a chance to order a coffee or any drink while deciding what to order. We continued to wait 15 minutes if not more to order even a coffee nevermind food. Unfortunately we had to get up and leave, the staff I mentioned at first didn‚Äôt seem to even notice and were again together behind the counter talking. I say I was disappointed as I‚Äôve been here before and never encountered service like this. The food quality is great hence the visit just feel the staff really let it down on this occasion.

With the cold Atlantic winds in the air.

To Old Stone‚Äôs glow, a cozy delight.

Shielding us from the winds that blow.
An apple pie and a flat white grand,

Our main order either got messed up or not put into the computer right. We waited at least 30 minutes from starter to main. No apology from staff. They came to double check our order after 20 minutes or so from when we got starters. The plates were not hot. The cod was middling temperature and the ""roast potatoes"" were clearly boiled and sitting around in some heating pot but they were not roasted. It was a pity because it was good quality fish. The salmon dish was fine. Overall disappointed in lack of apology and acknowledgement of the long wait time.

Even now your reputation does not allow you to apologize for the bad mood that lasted until the end of the day.

The service wasn't very good either. The waiter gave us just a small piece of bread and didn't bring us more when we asked. That‚Äôs pretty stingy.

Tank and Skinny's,Donegal,"Main St, Muff, Co. Donegal, F93 XC9H, Ireland",Cafe,4.7,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 5 stars - Tank & Skinny's is a restaurant chain from Donegal specialising in breakfast and lunch. I visited the Muff branch and was really impressed with the branding, interior and the menu.
There are a number of vegan options but I tried the Vegan breakfast which was delicious. The portion was amazing and the prices reasonable, it was very busy and I can see why! I would definitely advise trying it out and I would love to them spread further in NI, I think they would do fantasticly in Belfast! Overall very good experience will definitely be back üòä (by Tiarn√°n Byrne) [3 weeks ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Having been a regular customer for years, this place has worked out the kinks to provide great service.
The coffee tastes great and the food follows suit.
Prices are reasonable for the quality of food and service (see in photos).
A regular favourite is the breakfast burrito and a new favourite (pictured) is Hungers Mother with a delicious sweet chilli cheese mayo.
Be prepared to wait for a seat as people regularly flock here for a nice time to spend with family and friends.

I was doubly impressed by the vegan options and the thought given to making sure side salads etc were also vegan ü•∞ the salt n chilli wrap n Ultimate Vegan chips were amazing! Will have to be back üíï (by Clare Gallagher) [10 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - First timers and holiday makers here. We came to the village to stock up on outdoor gear in Borderland. We headed in here for refreshments after. I ordered the Tandoori chicken wrap with crisps or salad for ‚Ç¨9.90 and a Strawberry milkshake at ‚Ç¨3.90. Both thoroughly enjoyed. My husband opted for Bang bang chicken as a main ‚Ç¨10.90. He loved it and reported it was flavoursome and very filling. He also ordered an Americano at ‚Ç¨3.20 and was pleased with it. Our two kids shared one portion of Kids chicken goujons and chips at ‚Ç¨5.90. They devoured this and also managed to make a substantial dent in my milkshake. When we arrived we had to wait 10 minutes for a table but it was worth the wait. The place was buzzing and the menu has some original and very tasty elements. Overall this place is a must if you are passing through or near this Donegal village. Impressive and plenty of parking out the back. We will definitely return if in the vicinity. (by Emily O'Connor) [a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - What a Gem of a place!  Friendly staff!  Great aesthetic!  Delicious food!  We ordered off the breakfast menu and each one of us was delighted!

(by Lisa Stewart) [3 years ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Great location with plenty of parking around the back. Lovely atmosphere inside with very cool decor.

Overall, a lovely place for coffee, breakfast or lunch. (by √ìrla Friel) [3 years ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Stopped in on our way through and had two excellent breakfasts. Seamless ordering and very friendly staff. Food and coffee piping hot and delicious. Wish we had a Tank and Skinny‚Äôs in County Down near us in Newcastle. I reckon it would be super busy!! Def 5 stars üåü (by Marian A) [4 months ago] | Review 9: 1 star - My partner and I came back here to give it one last try after 3 years and yet again we where let down.
The breakfast burrito had extra things in it that is not stated on the menu such as onion, peppers and the last time there was mushrooms. the burrito was soggy and disappointing a bit like the atmosphere in the cafe.
We both had a shock when the ‚Ç¨4.20 chips arrived as it appeared half the portion was missing as surely it couldn‚Äôt be ‚Ç¨4 for a child‚Äôs sized handful of chips?
Drinks, especially the matcha are well below average.
Inside is very loud and not relaxing, it‚Äôs impossible to have a conversation, last time I had the experience in here was at a cattle market.

Just avoid it, it‚Äôs disappointing and underwhelming compared to their cafe in Letterkenny. (by Shay Melaugh) [2 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Amazing place! The food was amazing, as was the coffee. Claire on check in was so friendly, all the staff seemed to like their jobs. We all noticed them chatting and laughing with the customers.

Nancy's Barn Ballyliffin,Donegal,"Main St, Ballyliffin, Clonmany, Co. Donegal, Ireland",Restaurant,4.7,,,,‚Ç¨10‚Äì20,"Review 1: 4 stars - Gave feedback that the ‚Äòhungry goat‚Äô ciabatta sandwich was rock hard on top & scalding hot beneath, very obviously pre-made & heated up in a microwave however the hostess then discounted our dessert from our bill as an apology for not enjoying the food which was very courteous and kind. The carrot cake was HEAVENLY! I did ask for ice cream served with instead of whipped cream & it still came with whipped cream so had to send that back but was worth the wait. Decor is very nice & atmosphere is welcoming and warm. Coffee wasn‚Äôt a desired taste so would avoid next time & the sun dried tomatoes were so chewy & burned I couldn‚Äôt even cut through them but I am intrigued so will be back. My husband enjoyed the seafood chowder & would order it again. (by Anne Mac) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - This restaurant is known for its chowder and I can see why!

(by Akram M) [a month ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Stopped in for dinner with 12 ppl (7 of which are kids!).
Great atmosphere, service and food. The sizzling duck smelt amazing every time the chef brought it past and the burgers the others had where fat n juicy (as they should be)!!
All the kids ate well, the fish n chips also went down well, even if the adult meal was just about too big for my 11 year old! (by John Harrison) [4 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - What an amazing place to eat! Everything was perfect, from the food (especially the chowder, which was absolutely delicious) to the warm and friendly service.

(by Gary Breen) [a month ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on why I like the place so much; it‚Äôs a vibe though. Food is alright (though the chowder really is very good)

But the look and feel of the place makes me feel all kinds of warm and fuzzy; especially love the back extension, it‚Äôs such a cosy, happy little spot for some lunch (by Mat Lake) [4 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - We‚Äôve had a veggie Irish breakfast and it was delicious.

The seafood was out of this world. I've eaten fresh crab, prawns and squid all over Ireland, Nancy's beat them all hands down!

Get the Seafood Platter, it'll not disappoint!

Donegal, F94 XO43, Ireland",Indian restaurant,4.7,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 5 stars - Could not find one negative thing to say about our experience at Spice Waves in Bundoran. Took a chance and walked in, but would recommend a reservation. My family and I got a different starter each and shared a bit each as the portions are so generous. We had the samosas, shish kebab and the onion bhaji and each one was delicious. I had a lamb korma for my main and again it was delicious, my wife got the biryani and my daughter goth the sizzling kebab and it was all just fantastic. We got a couple of garlic naan bread and drinks and the lot came to ‚Ç¨103. Some might say that was expensive but the quality was second to none and I can‚Äôt think of another Indian restaurant in Ireland that comes close to this one. The staff were also helpful and friendly and offered suggestions if you are not someone who regularly goes to Indian restaurants. Would definitely recommend a visit. I would highly recommend a visit to this hidden gem. (by Thomas Clarke) [2 weeks ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Wow, wow, wow, an absolutely fantastic meal. Loads of free parking right outside the door. We popped in on the of chance and we just about managed to get a table so I'd recommend making a reservation. The service was really good, our waiter even offered to give us suggestions if we needed help. We got 3 different starters between us and we all had a bit of each to try them. The onion bhaji were the best I've ever tasted. The shish kebabs and samosas were fab. For mains we had a korma, mains Shish kebabs and a biryani. My biryani was absolutely amazing, so aromatic, fresh and so tasty I used very little of the accompanying sauce. My husband loved his korma and the lamb was so tender. This is by far the best Indian I have had in year's. We cant wait to go back. (by Lisa Clarke) [2 weeks ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Beautiful meal at Spice Waves. We had the Veg Platter for starter, Korma for main and a chef special and a side of garlic and coriander naan bread and it was all delicious! The guys really looked after us
And we had a really lovely and relaxing night out! Will be back soon! (by Aine Balfe) [2 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Amazing.

Monday night and still busy, would advise booking just in case.  Food lovely and a special touch was at the end when the chef came around each table asking if you enjoyed your food.  I thought this was a thoughtful touch. I would highly recommend. (by Joanne Day) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - I walked into Spice Waves expecting a fantastic meal, and to be fair, it didn‚Äôt disappoint - though there's room for some refinement.

Food:

The food was solid, but there‚Äôs room to take it to the next level. I had the Chicken Biryani, which was flavorful, though I would have liked a bit more of the aromatic spices to really make it pop. The Lamb Rogan Josh was tender, well-cooked, and packed with flavor, I‚Äôd love to see a little more heat and intensity in the sauce. I can tell there‚Äôs potential here - just needs a bit more balance and oomph to really make it sing.

Service:

Service was friendly and attentive, which is always a plus. The staff made sure we were looked after, though a touch more efficiency wouldn‚Äôt hurt - especially when it comes to getting the food to the table at the same time. But, no complaints; they were doing their best, and that‚Äôs all you can ask for.

Ambiance:

The ambiance was cozy and welcoming, perfect for a casual meal. It‚Äôs a nice spot to sit back and relax, though it does get a bit tight when it‚Äôs busy. I‚Äôd love to see just a little more space, but the vibe was good overall.

Conclusion:

Spice Waves has got a lot going for it. The food was tasty, the service was warm, and the atmosphere was inviting. With just a little more attention to balancing the flavors and refining the timing, this place could be incredible. I‚Äôll be back for sure - it‚Äôs a solid spot with the potential to be even better.

I have to admit pizza isn't my first choice for an evening meal but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavour choices of pizza and all at a reasonable price. Nice choice of salads etc to accompany the pizza also. Staff were super attentive and friendly. A wednesday night and probably 20 seated outside with another 50 inside when we left- that answers the question on it's reputation and I certainly would recommend it to try. Great drinks selection apart from not having a nice rose wine and just zinfandel. (by Steven B) | Review 4: None - This is a review of the pizzeria! It is absolutely worth the wait! According to my husband, their gluten free pizzas are the best he has ever had since developing Celiacs and my ‚ÄúPear Thomas‚Äù was one of my top favorite pizzas of all time.

Seems like it varies from night to night. A very easy place to have a group gather. (by Hannah Terry) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Great place for pint & pizza , lovely atmosphere

THE RAMBLING HOUSE BAR & RESTAURANT,Donegal,"Main St, Laghy, Laghey, Co. Donegal, F94 Y048, Ireland",Restaurant,4.8,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 4 stars - If you're looking for nice and peaceful restaurant in a country side then this place should be on your list to explore. The restaurant is at Main Street of small town  Laghey. They serve food all day with bar food served separately. We ordered Vegetable curry with Tofu option and Chicken Grilled Burger and to complete the meal at last we had ordered their Chocolate and Guinness Cake. The food was not the fancy one but was quite ok as there was nothing great to differentiate but their Chocolate and Guinness Cake made our evening special.
The staff were knowledgeable and helpful, offering great recommendations to try from the menu.  The service was top notch and pretty handy when we asked to lower the TV volume as we had a child with us. The restaurant is huge and has loads of seating area and tables to accommodate a very large number of people. The soft lighting and comfortable seating created a relaxing and inviting environment. One can just freshen their mind by just looking at the decorative and creative pieces and arts all around. Every hanging piece of art had their own caption and own meaning to standout.
The bar section is totally a place to look at. It was perfectly organized highlighting all the types of liquor they serve.
Talking about the parking, there is plenty of parking space available at the back of the restaurant and they also have outdoor sitting as well to enjoy in the nice weather.
Do not keep high expectations on food. The food tasted decent enough to eat so not a problem for eaters like me who do not seek 5 star taste and service everywhere.
Overall a nice place to enjoy your time. (by ajay harmale) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - We were traveling from the States and this was the best food so far. The atmosphere was welcoming and the staff was kind and helpful, and it was the best fish n chips I think I‚Äôve ever had! Thank you! (by Nicole Feltman) [a week ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - I stopped in after seeing all the road signs, and it was one of the few places open that was not fast food. The burger didn‚Äôt taste like a burger, nor did it look like a burger. The best thing about the burger were the onion rings that came on it. The fries tasted as if they had come out of the freezer with no flavor and were ‚Äúhard‚Äù on the inside. A fast food burger and fries would have been more tasty and a lot cheaper. The goat cheese tart was average. Overall, a disappointing meal. The restaurant was empty save for a couple of couples getting drinks. Perhaps the atmosphere would be more lively with more people, but it was dead. The server was kind and checked in on me. I would not go back for food; perhaps on a night with music and socializing I would go for entertainment. (by Kristy Fountain) [3 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Great food, great service!
Maura is a gem. She told us a lot about the area and the history of Derry and Ireland. She explained the Irish language and generally made us feel welcome.
The fish and chips are spectacular. The roast beef was next level.
Fast service and great food.

We had seafood chowder to start, and it was lovely and full of big chunks of fish. It wasn't a massive portion, but it was enough. We both had the haddock and chips, and it was beautiful. The batter was really crispy, and the chips were homemade. There is plenty on the menu to suit everyone, and we will definitely return. Highly recommended!!!

The beef stew and potatoes (other than fish and chips only one of two or three menu items which could be considered Irish) was very good.  Our friends treated so not sure of pricing.  Interior decor is eclectic but cramped.  No view of beautiful Foyle as it is situated off and perpendicular to the beach. (by David Lagerlef) [4 months ago] | Review 8: 3 stars - A bit of chaos with information. We ordered drinks while waiting to order from menu outside. After drinks came we were told we could only have pizza and sides sitting in the outdoor pods after 5pm. We hadn't intended getting pizza but. This was at 6:15, however the table opposite were eating other items from the menu. Some signage and/or clarity from staff would be great.

I had to ask for garlic mayo three times before it was given to me, and by that time, my chips were already cold.

Portion size is good, but your paying more for the lovely environment (by C T) [a year ago] | Review 4: 2 stars - I gave a good review in January and April, however I was there today and the service has declined, no mention of specials, poor attitude from waiting staff, 30min wait for the main course.

Expecting better service for the price

Starter was small, less than half mozzarella for the caprese

The young waitress did not make us feel welcome this time, maybe having a bad day.

We asked if possible to seat at the front with seaview but we were told a group was coming.
We left 90mins later and the seats were still empty with other guests who arrived after us seated on some of the ""reserved"" tables.

As I went to Quay West a number of times, I know the ""reserved"" sign is always there on the seats with the best view, it's down to the waitress to pick who who seats there.

The steak sandwitch was good but I dont think I will go back. (by M D) [Edited 3 years ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Staff is very helpful üëç

It was one of our best experiences!!!
First of all, I want to say that the service was fantastic. The staff was very professional and very friendly, ready to serve and answer any question you had about the place.
Leo's Tavern has a wide variety of beers, and the food that they served there was served, giving you the impression that it is supposed to be served like that.
Thank you for the experience we had and I urge everyone to at least go there once.
I am sorry for not knowing the names of the staff so I can give gratitude.
Since I am from greece, I don't know if I will be able to visit Leo's Tavern again, but if I visit Ireland again, I will surely go again.
Until then,I will miss you... (by Mike Apostolakis) [Edited a year ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Came here Saturday afternoon after my nieces christening. Food was amazing!

(by Noel Maguire) [2 years ago] | Review 7: 3 stars - Service was very quick and courteous, but the food was lacking. I asked for a steak sandwich with the meat medium rare. When it arrived, it was unevenly cooked, with one end almost medium rare and the other end less than rare, almost uncooked, and the meat had a lot of grizzle.  My wife's fish and chips was ok.

He's a big Enya fan, so he was excited to visit sights around Donegal associated with her and her music, including Leo's Tavern, opened by her father, and now owned by one of her brothers. The whole Donegal area is beautiful, and Leo's Tavern was a great, traditional Irish pub with a great atmosphere. They have some great local beers - I had a delicious red ale from Errigal Brewing Company. We also had their Mussels appetizer and Fish & Chips for dinner. Both very good. The walls of the restaurant display a lot of mementos and awards from both Enya's career and her family's group, Clannad. If you're in the Donegal area, I recommend making a stop at Leo's.

I had a ""meh"" burger for 18 Euros and my wife had the vegetable quesadilla for an eye-watering 23 Euros.

Me and my dad ordered a blue cooked steak which was really good and well made and I wont deny.
Although, my sister ordered a 28 EUROS seafood plate that contained barely anything consistent and a very very miserly portion of sea food. I'm talking like 10 mussels a tiny crab claw and a morsel amount of hake which could have easily been mistaken for a starter.
I cannot believe you would charge that much money for so little food.
Apart from that, the waitress that served us was very nice and friendly.
Upon leaving and paying, my sister brought up the quantity of food in her plate to the cook and she didn't even apologize or have any consideration, instead, she just got mad at her staff and at our waitress who was very very uncomfortable and didn't deserve such treatment.
Overall, good tasting food but very poor quantities and a very rude chef, would not recommend.

The room we were staying in was just updated to the new standard and as you can see from photographs below it is too high standard. (All rooms will be upgraded to this style)
The Bed and pillows were made for a very good night's sleep. The walk-in shower with its easy to use controls was excellent for us older folk.
We were at the back of the hotel so the views were not great. but we stayed in a room at the front before so we know the views from there are stunning looking over Pollen Bay to Malin head in the distance.
I always maintain that staff are what makes a stay enjoyable in a hotel and the staff of the Ballyliffin hotel & spa go the extra mile to make your stay memorable.

The Restaurant and Jacks bar food is of a high quality and good value (Only small gripe service can be slow & confusing. Maybe if staff were allocated serving areas it would reduce waiting time and mixed up orders) Loved the main meal but the crunchy ice cream dessert was a knockout blow for me wow tasty tasty.
There is so much to see and do around the Ballyliffin area, we visited the Famine village as we were aware of the treble fire at the start of the year and had to show are support for Pat & Majella who work so hard there. Then a quick drive up to Malin Head the most Northerly point in Ireland with stunning views over the wild Atlantic.
Our overall stay was fantastic, enjoyable, relaxing and we would highly recommend staying here as we plan to return with family in September. (by Tommy Oh Byrne) | Review 6: None - Room

We had a lovely, spacious room with a view down to the beach (weather permitting) and of the front of the hotel. Both bedroom and bathroom had all necessary amenities, clean and plenty of space.

Everyone working at the hotel was friendly and helpful. They also had great chat and gave us some tips on where to visit locally to make the most of our trip (as over for a wedding).

Seafood chowder was very good, definitely a 10 out of 10. The pork sandwich was just average. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend ordering extra chips ‚Äî ‚Ç¨6 per portion and they tasted over-fried in old oil.

Service was fast with drinks and decent with food. Atmosphere was nice and relaxed, no loud music, even though the place was busy.

We finished with the Summer Berry Tart, which was just as delightful. Crisp pastry, sweet-tart berries, and the perfect amount of cream. Highly recommend!

And we also ordered the penne pasta and were warned ahead of time that it was spicy. We‚Äôve been to Thailand, we‚Äôve had really spicy Thai, Mexican and Indian food, this was going to be fine, right? Wrong! The chef decided to put only red pepper flakes in it. I mean, you definitely get the hear but where was the flavor?? The garlic and tomato flavor did not come through because of how much red pepper flakes were in the dish.

We had the most delicious and FRESH lobster and crab. They told us we couldn't have chips because the fryer was off, but their brother (sorry I didn't catch your name!) brought us chips anyway, which was so sweet.

We went for lunch at this place and the place was almost full. No doubt why this place is always full. The food served here was spectacular and lip smacking as the name suggests ""Proper Street Food"".
We had ordered one from their specials -- Korean fried chicken burger and other from the lunch menu -- Lebanese styled falafels taco which was served with salad and chips on the sides.
We were absolutely delighted with the burger and would highly recommend having it if it is on the specials menu the day you visit.
The tacos were also excellent which was served with chips and salad on the side.
Not to forget the well brewed coffee, who doesn't like a nice coffee.
They also serve delicious desserts like cakes and pastry which are a must have after such delightful meal.
The service was top notch and the staff were very friendly and polite all the time. The food was served hot and fresh within a reasonable time.

We approached a staff member (not sure if they were a cashier or a waiter) to ask about the price of the tiramisu. Unfortunately, they didn‚Äôt know and just ran off saying ‚Äúone moment‚Äù ‚Äî we ended up waiting for about three minutes while they were gone. Eventually, they came back and told us it was ‚Ç¨3 for a portion of tiramisu served in a plastic container, around 200 grams.

Sadly, the dessert was very disappointing: it was hard in texture, had an overpowering smell of alcohol, and the taste was unpleasant ‚Äî we couldn‚Äôt finish it and had to throw it away. Moreover, no one told us if we were allowed to sit anywhere, so we ended up eating on a worn-out bench in the shopping centre. We also had to ask for spoons separately.

Parking has no height restrictions so meant could park with roofbox or campervan easily. Space for about 15-20 cars probably and extra parking roadside probably possible.

Seems to share a path with their wheelhouse pods which would be handy.

Darragh was very nice and friendly,  talked and made us feel very welcome. Lovely big fire on, place was spotless, toilets were very clean and loads of hand wash and hot water. Will certainly be back and highly recommend this place for food. (by Grainne McGowan) | Review 2: None - Terrible!  Shocking actually.  We visited the restaurant/bar around 8.30pm.
Filthy paper menu to start.  They felt disgusting to hold and we should have walked out, however we had drinks in front of us and there was nowhere else to eat in the area at that time.
We ordered fish & chips, thinking we hardly go too wrong.  When the food arrived, the batter was thick and dark brown.  Clearly the ‚Äúfreshly battered fish‚Äù had been fried in filthy old oil.  I couldn‚Äôt eat the batter, it was so disgusting.  I picked out the fish which was hardly there, must have been a small piece of cod before it was lathered in thick batter.  The chips needed a little more cooking and the mushy peas were directly out of a tin.
I rarely write bad reviews, I prefer not to damage a struggling business.  I just need to let other know so they can manage their expectations should they have the absolute need to eat here. (by Hazel Johnston) | Review 3: None - We stopped in here for a spot of dinner and really enjoyed the very traditional atmosphere. The bar man and server were lovely, friendly and so helpful.

We enjoyed it so much that we went back the second night for dinner as well. The food was lovely, freshly cooked and the dessert were sweet and tasty.

There was a lovely log fire burning in the background and we‚Äôre definitely recommend here for dinner.

The food is simply delicious and we were all delighted with our meals. I had the chicken Jalfrezi special and it was yum. Spicy enough without been too hot. The good thing is that the food is consistently good, in the 3+ years that we have been going there. We'll definitely be returning. (by L B) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Went to the Curry Cottage today with the family, and every one of us left delighted, each dish had beautiful spices and tasted gorgeous, even the cheesecake I got for dessert was fresh and tasted amazing,
I went for the Garlic chilli chicken bhuna and it would recommend to try it, very good blend of flavours and spices
On top of the food being amazing, the waiters are top notch, so friendly and always had a smile üòä
Will be returning üòÄ (by Ryan Wilson) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Fantastic. I had a Lamb sag, vindaloo hot, and it was. My wife‚Äôs pasanda was lovely. Lemon rice was the best I‚Äôve had in years. It was my birthday and I mentioned that when I was waiting for my takeaway. The guy behind the counter immediately gave me a free beer while I waited. Great experience.

Update 9 months on. I ordered the same again and there was a big mix up! I had to take it back. I‚Äôd ordered a lamb sag and I got a chicken sag. Or did I? The chef was adamant it was lamb, I was adamant it was chicken. The problem was it was ‚Äú‚Äùtikka‚Äù! I never ever order tikka, I want the meat, not the frozen marinaded stuff. Even when I got the replacement they‚Äôd still used tikka lamb and honestly I‚Äôd have still argued it was chicken!

But, it was gorgeous, extremely tasty lemon rice and mushroom rice. But seriously, I DO NOT want tikka. If I‚Äôd wanted tikka I‚Äôd have ordered tikka.

Through this mistake, the staff were fantastic. Professional, attentive, not at all defensive. Couldn‚Äôt do enough to sort it out. It‚Äôs honestly down to just serving what is ordered, not what you think the customer wants. (by C) [Edited 3 weeks ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - They have excellent service. My wife is a vegan due to dietary restrictions and they have always been wonderful. The server we usually end up getting always remembers her being a vegan and answers all her questions about dishes.

Donegal, Ireland",Cocktail bar,4.8,,,,‚Ç¨1‚Äì10,"Review 1: 5 stars - During my recent trip to Donegal, my hosts introduced me to a true hidden gem - The Shamrock LodgeüçÄNestled in the heart of town, this cozy pub is far more than a place for a pint - it‚Äôs a gathering spot where the local community comes together, stories flow as freely as the laughter, and friendships are built.
What struck me most was that you don‚Äôt need to raise a glass of Irish beer to feel the spirit of the place - the warmth, camaraderie, and hospitality embrace you the moment you step inside.
If you ever find yourself in Donegal, don‚Äôt miss this little haven. A heart, heritage, and a true Irish welcome! Here‚Äôs to new friends, timeless traditions, and finding community wherever you go.

(by Ann) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - A HUGE thumbs up to the Shamrock bar for allowing dogs inside and recognising what customers want.

There is not a single other bar, cafe, restaurant, shop or building within Falcarragh or all the surrounding towns that will allow dogs inside. Every place we've tried have rejected us with our small cockapoo dog. They really need to recognise the changing times and what customers want, they are losing so much business. The rest of the world is changing and starting to understand what their customers want and Ireland is being left behind, again.

If someone was to open a dog friendly cafe and advertise the fact in a busy place like Dunfanaghy etc they would get a roaring trade from dog owners and those that like to pet dogs.

Come on, get with the times and recognise what your customers want, there is a reason why the rest of the world is starting to allow dogs in.

Well done to The Shamrock Lodge bar!!!!!! (by Andy Czyzewski) [Edited a year ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - I've been to The Shamrock Lodge couple times on my travels now.  Great Pub to grab a pint of Guinness.  It's set up as a traditional Irish Pub.  Smaller front bar, and a larger area in the rear with a pool table and juke box.
There's an outside patio in the rear, with a few tables.  Even sheltered tables for smokers that don't want to get wet.  Both didn't work for me that night.  The wind was crazy.  Don't miss the mural of the story of legend of Balor. He's pretty famous in this region.  It shows Balor's death by Lugh, the princess that was sent to Tory Island.  The mural has seen better days, but it is outside and the weather can take its toll on it.
Food is not served here, but there are takeout menu's around.  The place wasn't crowded on this particular Saturday night, but neither was the other pub I visited while waiting for my cab. Don't Drink and Drive! (by Robert Paflitzko) [7 years ago] | Review 8: 2 stars - Nice enough bar but clean robbery.

Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, best chips I had in a while. Why not 5 / 5? Maybe add a little twist like adding a bit of beef fat Iin the fryer. Steak 4.5 / 5 perfectly medium but a little bit anaemic looking, bit hotter pan for a good maillard reaction but definitely a good steak. Not a salad person but this one was good, maybe some vinaigrette to keep it mouster. Goes perfectly with a Kinnegar Craggy Bay IPA. Will I be back? For sure!

We had the sea food platter which is one of the most expensive items on the menu but is was a disappointment.  The prawns seem to be from lidl and were cold, the mussels were cold seem to be from a jar or tin, the crab legs were nice( all 4 of them)  and the platter was bulked out with a salad. The smoked salmon was OK. Overall not a Plate to warrant the cost. My colleagues thought the pasta was poor for the price. The location is fabulous with a great view of the Atlantic from the windows,  it's a shame they allow cars to park in front of the window to block the view.

I had the fish (haddock) and chips served with a small side salad. The fish was wrapped in a lovely batter and the chips are amazingly scrumptious.

Firstly when I was trying to book I was doing a solo trip and couldn't get a table for one online, but after a few emails to Siobh√°n she got one for me, which I'm so glad of now.

Siobh√°n greeted me as I came in and was very friendly and helpful.

I went for 3 courses and a glass of wine. They have a great wine list and the one I got was great, I heard others also loving their wine.

For starters I got the Croquettas, they were so delicious, the mayo, the chorizo and cheese combination, it was great.

Next up for the main, I choose the Noones free range chicken. This may be the best chicken dish I have had in my life, really crispy skin around the chicken breast, the chicken drumstick was super tender and the mash was perfect. This was such a great main, and for my side I had got the glazed carrots and they were absolutely divine.

Lastly for the desert, I got the Chocolate orange delice, this was fantastic also although I was bursting at the brim by this point. The smooth creamy chocolate delice and the walnut and blueberry combo was perfect.

The staff were very friendly and very helpful.

The atmosphere was great, it was quiet for me which was great as I had a book, and the music also was very good.

I love the decor as well, there are amazing paintings all along the wall upstairs and I wanted to go around looking at them as if in a gallery.

From my seat as well I could also see out to the cliffs and water which was amazing.

This was a truly amazing dining experience, thanks to the Cove Restaurant for giving me such a good time. (by Gary conlon) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 3 stars - To say I was disappointed here would be an understatement but my wife had a better experience than I hence the three out of five instead of one/two.

To start it seemed the night we visited they may have been short staffed or missing a manager - the three wait staff were doing their best but I‚Äôd say need some older/experienced guidance. The menu definitely sets up the belief that this will be a five star experience - but it falls short‚Ä¶

The starters were by far the best experience of the night they arrived fairly quick and were delicious - zero issues here.

An hour and 15 minutes after this our mains arrived, my wives was excellent exactly what she was expecting - my lamb shoulder was partially cold and lacking in quantity and quality with about 1/5 of what it was being gristle or bone/fat which was inedible.

Other issues were trying to get attention of staff towards the end and unsure if it was the owner or someone else sat chatting to them instead of letting them clear up for the evening.

A comment from my wife was that the room was fairly filled with smoke from the kitchen, some better ventilation required.

All in all what seemed like it would be a delicate and nice experience turned into something that McDonalds could have rivalled for atmosphere and speed. Seems previous awards no longer represent what is possible at least on this night. (by Shane Porter) [3 weeks ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - I went there with my family last night.

My lamb with harissa main was delicious.  There were plenty of good options on the wine list which were very reasonably priced compared to what I am used to in the UK.

There is a great variety of dishes with vegetarian and meat options. The second time I visited, we had ordered spring rolls and seafood chowder for starters. They were absolutely tasty and came within record time I'll say. For mains we had ordered carbonara, chicken Supreme with sauce, kofta balls, and a burger with fries.

I had the Fillet of Hake with chorizo samphire spinach and herb vegetable rosti at ‚Ç¨25 which was very good. Total bill came to ‚Ç¨95. Staff picked up on a throwaway comment by me in reference to the birthday boy (it was my husband's birthday and a significant one) and marked it which I was impressed with and loved so thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è I'd highly recommend dining here if you are staying in the hotel or if you are nearby. (by Emily O'Connor) [9 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - I had a wonderful dinner with my family at this restaurant.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  We only ordered main dishes, but each dish was nicely presented and perfectly cooked.  Lamb was cooked medium, as ordered, and the fish was cooked just right.  The only negative is that fish dishes were under seasoned, but that was easily solved by salt and pepper that we had at the table.
Overall, this was a very good  experience, and I can definitely recommend this restaurant.

Andersons Boathouse Restaurant And Accommodation,Donegal,"Main St, Cashelcummin, Killybegs, Co. Donegal, F94 X21X, Ireland",Restaurant,4.7,,,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - Outstanding dining experience. At the end of the meal, Garry came out to say hi. What a great guy. What an amazing team. The food is fantastic. Everything we ate was carefully prepared and delicious. It‚Äôs a must if you find yourself in Killybegs. (by Seamus McEvoy) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - This was the first time my boyfriend and I visited Anderson's boathouse restaurant and we were both impressed. The place was busy when we arrived for our 8:15pm reservation. (Booking is definitely recommended so not to be disappointed if you can't get a table just by walking in). We were there on 12th July which also fell on a Saturday so it was busy with holiday makers and locals too. We were welcomed by a member of staff when we came in, only took a minute or so, if even. We were shown to our table which just needed to be wiped down as the previous couple of people had not long left. This was fine, we could see how busy they were. We were told about the specials and who would be serving us and we took our seats. We both got to order a drink each quite promptly and they came out quick enough. I got a gin bramble and my boyfriend got a bottle of Peroni. We then decided what we'd like and shared the mussels to start, the portion was quite small for 2 to share but would have been ample for one. They were tasty and then we had both ordered a fish dish each for our main. My boyfriend had the monkfish and I had the hake, we both tried each others and they were both very tasty meals. We thoroughly enjoyed our drinks and food. The staff were very friendly, attentive and efficient. The atmosphere was buzzing, the position we were in, we were getting a lovely breeze from the open doors at the other end and could see the harbour. We could hear low playing music which was nice and it wasn't so loud in the restaurant with others that you couldn't hear each other speak. We would definitely return, we had booked on short notice but still managed to get a table so that was wonderful. I have no negatives from our experience. (by Megan Chism) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - The food was delicious and beautifully presented, the staff were so attentive and friendly.

We had the prawn and monkfish starter - rich, creamy, and so delicious. I got the John Dory special for the main - never had this fish before and I hope to have again in the future - the dish was incredible. We topped off our meal with the sticky toffee pudding and was so gooooood! Staff were super nice, helpful, and welcoming and loved the chill ambiance of the restaurant - thank you! (by Caroline Martin) [a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Wonderful absolutely wonderful, the risotto was splendid perfectly balanced with just the right amount of portions mixed with the right amount of spices.

Anderson‚Äôs Boathouse Restaurant is seamlessly run restaurant with the nicest staff and offers a delicious selection of starters, mains, desserts & cocktails. The seafood is the nicest I‚Äôve tasted anywhere in Ireland. This place is not to be taken lightly! When you go, you just want to indulge in all the beautiful food & drinks. The staff are so personal, from the waitresses, to the manager to Garry himself coming out of the kitchen for a chat. Thank you for amazing service and food.. see you again in a few weeks. (by Rois√≠n Brennan) [Edited a year ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Celebrated my birthday recently here on 5th May. I can only say everything was absolutely flawless. I had the croustillant (highly recommend this!) to start and the seafood platter for main, both beautiful. Great wine menu, lovely surroundings looking out on Killybegs Harbour. Staff were fantastic, friendly and knowledgeable. A solid 10/10 and I'll come back to Killybegs not just for the lovely place that it is but especially for Anderson's Boathouse Restaurant.

The Red Door Country House,Donegal,,,4.7,,,,,"Review 1: None - We always have a great time at the Red Door.
The food is always delicious and it is a lovely place to celebrate a special occassion as the grounds are beautiful, as is the interior.  Food is always good.

This time we just dropped in foe bar food. It was delicious. There was a good choice on the bar food menu and it was reasonably priced for the quality of the meal we had. (by Kathryn Callaghan) | Review 2: None - Had a very nice meal here on a weekday evening.  It was not too busy and the staff were very attentive.  We didn‚Äôt stay in the accommodation but looks a good location and nice place for a lakeside wedding. (by Brian Haggis) | Review 3: None - A beautiful building with a stylish interior and a garden where you can also sit outside. We were in the bar area, where food is also served. The staff were friendly, but there‚Äôs room for improvement (taking glasses from the table with fingers inside is unprofessional, and after the meal, they didn‚Äôt ask if everything was okay).

The starters (pork belly and ham croquettes) were very good, but the main course disappointed us. The fish tacos were very dry ‚Äì just adding some juicy vegetables would have made a big difference. It‚Äôs not a bad place, but both the service and the food could use some improvement. (by BB) | Review 4: None - Early evening dinner. Beautiful location. Sadly the interior was a little shoddy and smelled mouldy.  The service was polite, but that's about it. The food also missed the mark... the dishes felt unfinished and the tastes were tuned to bland rather than wow. It's a shame, it could have been so much better (by smaryj66) | Review 5: None - This place is genuinely something special. I've photographed quite a few weddings at the Red Door, and every time I'm blown away. Francis and the whole team are just brilliant, they really go above and beyond, and it shows in every little detail. The setting itself is a dream: tucked-away woodland paths, thee iconic swing, and views overlooking Lough Swilly that make for absolutely stunning backdrops. It‚Äôs one of those places where you‚Äôre spoiled for choice with photo opportunities. And the food? Next level. They really know how to host a wedding here, elegance at best! Till next time.. (by James Aiken) | Review 6: None - I attended a wedding here in October 2024 and it was so amazing I had to write a review. The location is stunning, the grounds are immaculate, the house feels very welcoming and warm with beautiful decor. On top of that, this was hands down the best food I‚Äôve had at a wedding, really fine dining quality. What makes or breaks a place is the staff though and not only were they super efficient and professional, they were all exceptionally nice to deal with. I‚Äôd go back in a heartbeat. (by Geraldine Harp) | Review 7: None - The place is fabulous but we will not be eating there again because of the very poor quality food. (by Donata Romano) | Review 8: None - I came with my family to have their ‚Ç¨53pp 3 course festive menu. We come every year and are always impressed by the quality of food and service but, unfortunately, the standard has significantly dropped. The food was mostly average and my sister‚Äôs mushroom risotto was tasteless and unappealing. No one checked how our food was and they collected the uneaten risotto at the end without any remark. Once we pointed it out, they did apologise and took some money off her meal. Hoping they can improve as this is a beautiful venue in a stunning location. (by Helen) | Review 9: None - To be fair, you cannot match the atmosphere of the restaurant, it makes you feel like you are in a movie. The service was lovely and attentive, we got served bread and butter and a wee appetizer, which was such a nice treat. When it comes to the food, the starter was really really good! The mains all look amazing, and they delivered! The only negative point is that the starter and side was a bit colder than expected, and therefore felt like they had been made a while ago, otherwise, a very pleasant and recommended experience. (by Ferran Arlandis) | Review 10: None - I‚Äôve shot several weddings here and the staff and management are always fantastic to work with, attentive to detail, great at keeping the day flowing and the grounds are kept to a high standard and impeccably maintained, the atmosphere is cosy and personal for wedding guests and I haven‚Äôt tried the Guinness but it looks amazing.

Fridays wedding had adverse weather where it poured down the entire day and management were on the ball with opening areas for me to shoot and super helpful and on hand for any indoor shoot locations!

Looking forward to my 2025 weddings here, keep up the amazing work folks :)

Seafood chowder soup very tasty with delicious brown bread.

Tomato soup home made with great flavour.

Rhubarb tart with ice cream hit the spot with nice lumps of rhubarb.

Fish and chips. Light batter with fluffy white cod inside. Excellent tartare sauce and mushy peas.

2 cocktails for ‚Ç¨10 and Heineken for ‚Ç¨3 seems very good value.

The service was excellent and the food was delicious.  I would not hesitate to recommend Quay West. (by David Brennan) [a month ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - I recently had the pleasure of dining at an establishment in Donegal, where I enjoyed a delightful Parmigiana Chicken. The chicken was expertly prepared, with a batter that achieved the perfect level of crispiness. This delightful texture contrasted beautifully with the rich, tangy tomato sauce, creating a harmonious balance of flavors. Accompanying the dish were perfectly roasted, crunchy potato cubes that added an additional layer of satisfaction to the meal.

Additionally, I sampled the aromatic chicken curry, which was a true delight. The curry was exquisitely seasoned, with a complex blend of spices that complemented the tender chicken beautifully. Paired with a fragrant bed of rice, the dish was a wonderful example of culinary craftsmanship. This establishment in Donegal proved to be a charming venue, offering a memorable dining experience. (by J J) [a year ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Love that everything is sourced locally, enjoyed a Donegal whiskey.

(by apricotbaker pj) [a month ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - I had emailed the owner to book a table for 2 to celebrate a big birthday for my husband and mentioned to her of the occasion at the time of booking. She requested further information with a professional attention to detail. On arrival to the restaurant, I was very happy with our table by the window. The owner herself took our order and was very warm and friendly introducing herself and having the chat. We shared a Bottle of Spanish Tempranillo for ‚Ç¨28 which was good. We both decided to forego a starter to focus on the main event. I chose the 10z Rib Eye Steak (‚Ç¨32.50) with mushroom and onions and silkie whiskey and maple sauce (recommended by the owner) and included side of my choice (fries). My husband picked the 9oz Sirloin steak (‚Ç¨30.95) with mushrooms and onions and peppercorn sauce and (upgraded) side of garlic herb roasted potatoes with a supplement of ‚Ç¨1.50. We both added 4 craft beer battered king prawns for ‚Ç¨6.95 each to our steaks. We were both impressed with the steak (& how they were cooked to our asking), battered prawns, respective sauces, mushrooms and herby potatoes. We thought there was excess onions on each of our plates.
We shared the infamous caramel crunchie Sundae at ‚Ç¨9.50 which was good. Overall, I did think the dessert options were an area to improve on the menu. I was delighted that staff marked my husband's birthday with a flare candle suitably embarrassing him. I loved the fuss made of him and the occasion so big thank youüôåü•≥ I would recommend here for dinner and a special occasion where a deserved fuss is made on request.

The food however was decent.  My steak was perfect medium/rare. It was interesting to be able to watch the guy grill our steaks. However I felt VERY lucky as he was sweeping up the floor of wood bits and dirt etc and he used the pan to throw this filth into the fire and at the same time coving some of the steaks for other people......gross. definitely ignorant practise that needs to stop.

Came today and got the steak stack with the crispy cabbage, which I had never tried before, and it was absolutely delicious!! Waitress said there was a secret sauce on it which I would now love to find out. Defo recommend this place! (by s k) [a year ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Fabulous Steakhouse. Flame grilled steak grilled on open fire in front of us.
The flavour of open fire was so good on steak. Brought me back about 30 years!
Fabulous atmosphere. Lovely lovely staff. I‚Äôd walk 500 miles for those Parmesan & Truffle Fries again. Everything was perfect. Thank you!!! (by Elaine Cassells) [Edited a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Wow! I was not expecting such amazing food to come out of a hidden tavern like this. Had a drink at the bar then sat for dinner. I got the ribeye with buttery mash and oh my goodness it was divine. It was also grand seeing the old train as the steak grill- as well as the other nods towards it being an old train station! We went with a large group and they were extremely accommodating. (by Rachel Zafarana) [3 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Had been here once before for a works night out, and always wanted to return, so we did for a belated Valentine's treat. And it did not disappoint!
The interior is full of charm and memorabilia from the railway days of old. Staff were friendly and we were seated in front of the firebox grill, with flames jumping and the noise so comforting, as was the pleasant heat and mouthwatering smells of food!
I ordered a half pint of Guinness, and it was perfect. We ordered Ribeye steak and the burger. Fascinating to see the steak getting nicely done on the grill. It came out looking amazing, and cooked exactly as I'd asked, medium to well. My other halfs burger looked good also. My champ was delicious as were his chips. We left full and satisfied, too full to even attempt dessert! However we will be back again for sure. Highly recommend. (by v g) [Edited a year ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - What a gem of a restaurant..

We expected a bit of a wait since the menu mentioned that everything is made fresh, but we ended up waiting over an hour for our food. A couple of tables seated around the same time had already finished and left before we were served. That said, our server was very apologetic and kept checking in with updates, which we really appreciated. The only other downside to the experience was the woman who seemed to be the host or manager. She was not pleasant to interact with and came across as quite rude. (by Megan Dwyer) [a month ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Such a wonderful place to visit, so much we came back twice.

My wife and I were in Donegal for two nights and got dinner the first night where we met Ann (the owner) who served us a wonderful Italian meal. Having gluten free pasta for my wife was a huge highlight and such a treat especially when traveling.

After dinner the first night Ann offered us some wonderful suggestions for areas to visit while we were in town.

The second night we came back after visiting a local pub for some Irish music and grabbed dessert. Again we saw Ann who remembered us and we stayed probably for half an hour talking to her about the history of the restaurant, what we have left in our trip and overall just great conversation.

We both would HIGHLY recommend coming to visit La Bella Donna for your gluten free items and dessert of course! (by CJ) [a year ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - Food was lovely, but way over priced.

We are visiting Donegal for a few days from the US so based on positive reviews we called and made a reservation for 5pm which is opening time. We were not disappointed. I wish I knew our server‚Äôs name. She was lovely and very attentive. We had the bruschetta which was one of the best we‚Äôd ever eaten and each had a Caesar salad for our entree. Absolutely delicious and the portions were great. We even had dessert‚Äîmy sister had the gelato trio and I had the Tiramisu which I found out is made in house. So delicious I ate every bit of it. Would definitely recommend and eat there again . (by Sheila Baston) [3 years ago] | Review 8: 3 stars - My wife and myself visited here on Saturday of st Patricks weekend. Very busy as you might expect so I could forgive the service for our orders being a bit slow.
However we were seated in front of the bar and there simply isn't room for a table here, other couples were in the same situation.
The food was good and plenty of it, value was good also. The atmosphere is too bright in my opinion, just my own taste.
I can see why this is popular in Donegal town. (by Bert Carolan) [6 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Delicious food, will come back to eat here for sure.

Service fast water brought drinks order taken. Given time to read the menu  as we did this I noticed a lot of lamb coming out from kitchen so that's what I ordered. My friends ordered fish and chips. The fish was in golden batter light to taste they both commented how crispy the chips were delicious.  Now the lamb shank... lips smacking good  fell of the bone no struggle  it was served with creamy mash velvety jus that looked rich in colour and was equally rich in flavour..Delicious.  I was drive so had a cappuccino and Ice cream to finish. The coffee was hot which I love usually cappuccino is only warm  and it was served with a smile a bit of banter. Service throughout was professional friendly not intrusive.  Good atmosphere too..If in Letterkenny book your table and enjoy.

We made a reservation and the restaurant was packed and lively when we arrived. The presentation and service were good, but unfortunately, the food (chilli prawns & pasta, fish & chips) tasted of nothing. The pasta tasted like my own home cooking (passable but unremarkable) and the generous fish portion had no flavor at all. Just disappointed. (by Jeff Zhao) [8 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - The best meal we have had in years. Seafood platter was amazing, a king‚Äôs feast. Seafood stew/soup was to die for, just amazing.

Chandpur Restaurant,Donegal,"Main Street Car Park, Donegal, Ireland",Indian restaurant,4.3,,,,‚Ç¨20‚Äì30,"Review 1: 3 stars - We wanted to take a break from Irish food so popped in here for dinner. We love Indian food and have it often, but I think Indian food in Ireland may just be different from what we‚Äôre used to in Portland. We ordered the tikka masala, tandoori chicken and some garlic naan. The masala was super sweet. I am more used to a umami masala and less coconut flavoring. The naan‚Äôs texture was more along the lines of a thin crusted pizza. And lastly, the tandoori chicken was actually delicious. Without the tandoori chicken and basmati rice, I don‚Äôt think would have been satisfying. The service was excellent! (by Nichelle S) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - We were quite pleasantly surprised to find first rate Indian food at Chandpur in Donegal village. I had Chicken Tikka Jalfrezi which was tender, full flavored and perfectly spiced. My wife had Saag Paneer which she has ordered in dozens of restaurants, and proclaimed this was the second best she has ever had.

(by Christopher McCarthy) [4 months ago] | Review 6: 1 star - Quite literally the worst service I've ever had in any restaurant. After 1 hour 45 of waiting for our main courses (just 2 of us), I asked the waiter if the food was coming soon. His response was ""You've come in at 6 o'clock on a Saturday evening!"" as if to infer 'what do you expect?' No apology at all. Apparently going for dinner at 6pm at the weekend is the customer's fault now.

We paid for the wine that we ordered and then left, not having even seen the food. (by Chris Walsh) [a month ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - The food was incredible, very authentic Indian dishes. The servers were attentive and very kind, going above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience..especially dining with a baby. Highly recommend! (by Aideen Stack) [3 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Myself and my family went to Chandpur for the first time a few weeks back, we got a big array of different foods, including samosas, madras, jalfrezi, etc.., and every single dish was delicious, you could taste the flavors and spices, everything was cooked brilliantly. I have to admit that this restaurant is one of the best for authentic Indian dishes, offering a proper Indian dining experience with its music and decor.
We will be coming back, 10/10 (by Ryan Wilson) [3 months ago] | Review 9: 1 star - I genuinely don't understand how this restaurant has received such glowing reviews. The service was shockingly poor. We asked for water twice and only received it 20 minutes later‚Äîafter the wine had already been served. Even then, we had to ask three more times to get the water jug refilled.

When I inquired whether the Chicken Makhani or Butter Chicken could be made spicy, the waiter was condescending and dismissive. He claimed cream-based dishes *can‚Äôt* be made spicy, which is simply not true. He went on to say that the restaurant prepares food to suit the majority of Irish preferences. While that‚Äôs somewhat understandable, it‚Äôs not an excuse for refusing a reasonable request‚Äîor for making assumptions about your customers. He even said that *if* he were in India, he could make any dish spicy. Since when is did the waiters  at this establishment also become the chef? He didn‚Äôt even offer to ask the kitchen if my request could be accommodated.

I ended up ordering the lamb biryani instead, which I absolutely would not recommend. The lamb was dry, and the rice tasted like it had been pre-cooked days in advance‚Äîcompletely lacking depth and flavor. Other members of my group ordered different dishes, and sadly, none of them stood out. Everything tasted dull and uninspired.

Overall, the experience was extremely disappointing. Between the rude service and the lackluster food, I would not return and cannot recommend this place to anyone expecting quality food or hospitality.

So many restaurants now seem to plate up pre-prepared / wholesale (probably defrosted that morning) servings - which is why the all taste (and even look) the same.

Shannon‚Äôs is different. This is food the way your Mom used to cook it ( or you wished she would have in my case üòÇ)

Service was quick, atmosphere was lovely, decor was homely without being kitsch.

I had the pork chops with spuds and I‚Äôve never had pork chops so tender but still with bite, lovely (clearly home made) apple sauce on the side and mashed spuds with peas, carrots and broccoli. YUM!

The Thatch had been closed Tuesday and Wednesday so we ate here on the Thursday which was seafood special night and our last night in town. I ordered 1x chicken goujon and chips to share between the kids (both aged under 5). My Mum ordered John Dory special reasonably priced at ‚Ç¨23. She was extremely satisfied with her fish and gave it 10/10. I ordered the 8 oz Rib eye Steak with chips, carrots, broccoli, asparagus, pepper sauce, mushrooms and onions at ‚Ç¨22.50. To be honest, I was disappointed with my steak (quality, cut and way it was cooked) but then perhaps I'm a tough customer to please living on a beef farm. Furthermore, green beans and slivers of Courgettes replaced the advertised and promised asparagus. The wait between ordering and the food arriving was half an hour. Staff were friendly. I was pleasantly surprised when I went to pay to be informed that the kids meal was free when ordered with an adult meal. As a result, the overall rating for here swung towards excellent especially for value. Advice order fish specials on seafood special night (Thursday).

We decided to go for a family meal. Service was a little slow initially but nothing noteworthy, I had ordered the steak and thought it was somewhat dry, afterwards I happened to notice on the menu that the dish should of had a pepper sauce, I did mention this to a staff member but when I received the bill this error by the kitchen was not accounted for, when I noted this the waitress went to check with other senior staff and returned to tell me that as I didn‚Äôt complain earlier they would not adjust the price even though they served the dish incomplete. I then raised the issue with a senior staff member who‚Äôs first question was to ask me whether I was a resident in the hotel (why should that matter?). After deliberation, he returned to tell me that they would not charge me for a glass of house wine. To say we were disappointed is an understatement.

(by Deb B) [a year ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - We happened to be in town and fancied breakfast so here seemed a good bet. I had the avocado +poached eggs and decided to add bacon, whilst my companion had the large fry
The bread, avocado and poached egg were nice, in fact the basil oil around the plate added an extra zing...I do wish I hadn't added the bacon as it appeared either deep fried or re cooked in some way as it was brittle and lacked flavour
The fry was below par. Plenty of it but over cooked and perhaps not drained as the over whelming flavour was oil. I swapped one of my poached for my partner's fried egg and wished I hadn't as it was very far from runny and oily tasting.
The staff are attentive and friendly and run the front of house efficiently but I do think the meals are a little on the pricy side (by Hazel Stanton) [9 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - The best breakfast I have had in a long time - would highly recommend (by sorcha boyle) [a year ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - The best place you can eat!

The place was really quiet, which did surprise us given the summer period. The staff were helpful to a degree but would not say it was high quality service. Our pizzas were clearly frozen and took 35 minutes to arrive, my husbands beer was also not good and very dead. Although our package didn‚Äôt include anything additional, we weren‚Äôt given the opportunity to order any sides which we would have been happy to pay for separately. There was another customer who brought back her cocktail to the bar staff and then explained how to make a cocktail. Other customers I heard ask for their drinks and when told cocktails can take longer to make, responded that it had already been 35 minutes. The staff member making drinks clearly did not know what they were doing, I appreciate they may have been new but there was no one providing any training or guidance to them.

The resort boasts three outstanding golf courses, each offering a unique challenge and breathtaking scenery. Whether it was the meticulously maintained fairways, the clever course designs, or the stunning natural surroundings, every round felt world-class.

The service throughout the resort was without doubt some of the best in the business. Every staff member we encountered was professional, attentive, and genuinely committed to ensuring our stay was perfect. It‚Äôs rare to find such consistently high standards across the board.

Dining at the Vardon Restaurant was another unforgettable highlight. The food was truly outstanding beautifully presented, rich in flavor, and clearly crafted with the finest ingredients. Whether it was a casual lunch or a formal evening meal, every dish exceeded expectations.

Captain of Clonakilty GC (by paul crosbie) [4 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - The Vardon Restaurant is a spectacular experience. The food, setting and service is outstanding. The Hotel is first class with luxurious rooms. The value is tremendous. Add the three golf courses to the menu and we have a package that is ""best of class"" not only in Ireland but worldwide. Finally, the Casey family are genuinely great people and they personally make you feel like their most important guest. The staff culture is based on pleasing and welcoming their guests. Exceptional destination spot! (by Bill Barry) [4 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - We recently enjoyed a terrific dinner at the recently-remodeled Vardon restaurant. The updated decor makes the whole space seem lighter and airier. Tables are spaced nicely apart, but there was a lively buzz about the place which made for a great ambiance.

As for the food, coming from the US Pacific Northwest, I'm a salmon snob and I have to say the salmon was outstanding, as was our salad -- in my experience, not always the case in Ireland.

I was pleased to learn one thing that had not changed about the Vardon was the availability of the Scraggy Bay IPA -- my choice for best craft beer in Ireland!

We always look forward to our visits to Rosapenna, but the new Vardon has elevated the entire resort to another level. (by David Mihm) [4 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - The Vardon restaurant at the Rosapenna Resort is simply spectacular. The setting is one of the best in the world as you dine overlooking beautiful sheep-haven bay. The service is second to none as meals are presented by a very friendly staff from all over the world. The meals are delicious as the chef uses locally caught and grown ingredients which are served with a perfect assortment of side dishes. The wine selection is also excellent. Dining at the Vardon is a special night on the town. (by Quentin Lutz) [4 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - I have dinner at The Vardon Restaurant on many occasions both when staying at the Hotel and as just a guest for the day.

The view from the restaurant is sensational over looking the bay, equally matched by the exceptional service, crisp white tables cloths and delicious food. On a recent visit, I enjoyed fresh local lobster. It was sublime. Just writing this review is getting me excited for my next visit to the Vardon Restaurant.

It comes highly recommended!! (by Patrick Home) [4 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - The staff and service are top-notch, the food is always amazing, and there is plenty of it. The views of the ocean are spectacular, making the atmosphere magical. When I arrive in June, this will be my seventh time, and I eat breakfast and dinner every day the entire week I am there. The way you are treated feels like home. I highly recommend dining at the Vardon Restaurant.

Dr Frank (by Frank Berzanskis) [4 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - I  have come to Ireland for golf since the mid 1980‚Äôs playing the links courses all over. After my first game years ago at Rosapenna it became my annual destination. The top quality hospitality, service, facilities and dining enhance the world class golf experience. The level of cooperation between Rosapenna and the surrounding community and other golf facilities is remarkable. The staff treat guests like family: Highly recommended!! (by Tom Ackert) [5 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - We make a trip to Rosapenna each year and the Vardon restaurant is a fantastic part of our trip.  The food is excellent, the staff is warm and friendly, and the view of Sheephaven Bay is breathtaking.  There is a wide selection of entrees and the wine list is superb.  I highly recommend dining at the Vardon!

Pirates of the Coffeebean,Donegal,"Beach, An Fhearthainn, Co. Donegal, Ireland",Cafe,4.8,,,,‚Ç¨1‚Äì10,"Review 1: 5 stars - Our favourite regular place in Donegal! Everyone is so kind. The food is always delicious : salad, soup, and the new evening menu is incredible! Just so happy to come here all the time! Because of the success it gets busy at summertime : best to come off-peak if you can. A great place for the whole family anytime in the day. (by L D) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - After a long beach walk this cafe on the edge of the car park was perfect. Dog friendly with breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. We had coffees and a toastie but were certainly tempted by the array of traybakes and cakes. (by Stephen McCalden) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - A lovely spot right beside the beach. The food was lovely, staff were friendly and very helpful. Its dog friendly too which was an added bonus so we didn't have to worry about our pooch being too hot in the car. Will definately return the next time we're in the area! (by C G) [2 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Stayed at the caravan park beside the cafe for the 2nd year in a row and would be in cafe throughout the whole weekend. The staff are so friendly and professional, the food is always great and we loved the seaside decor inside. (by Stewart Thomson) [a month ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - A must-visit if you‚Äôre in the area. Great selection of food catering for different dietary requirements and staff are very friendly. It‚Äôs a popular spot so can be busy but always worth the wait! (by Larisa) [5 months ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - A cute little pet-friendly spot in Portnoo. We only went in for coffee, but we were warmly welcomed and the doggo's each got a free puppachino. The staff were really friendly. (by Marli Heyneke) [a year ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Must stop. Great coffee. Great soup. Great sandwich. Right along the beach. Excellent stop after hiking. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. (by Paul Nickisch) [4 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - 5 Stars in every respect!

We visited every day for 4 weeks, as we did last summer. All of the food was delicious. Our family favourites were:
Cinnamon bun (the best)
Overnight oats
Ham & cheese croissant
Spicy chicken on sourdough bread/focaccia
Parma ham & pear pizza

Everything at Pirates was just as good if not better than we get back home in London.

Excellent service, staff happy and smiley ‚Ä¶..

We'll be back again next year.

Will not stay here again.  We ate in restaurant the night we arrived.  Food was ok but nothing special.  Our room was above bar.  Very noisy until well into the early hours so not much sleep. (by Audajohns1997) | Review 5: None - Stay clear. Not family friendly. Bad food

Very poor customer service. Basically non existent. Arrived and told to wait to be seated and then 10mins later had to ask could we site down. Asked a male member of staff where the baby changing area was and he said he didn‚Äôt know. It was in the toilet and it was wet and dirty.
Food was no good. Childs portions for 18‚Ç¨
Never asked if we needed anything and charges 75‚Ç¨ for overpriced food. All frozen food. Nothing fresh. (by Chris Lee) | Review 6: None - We got charged ‚Ç¨5 for 2 pints of tap water with a dash of mi wadi. Absolutely scandalous. Even the waitress seemed embarrassed about it. Not sure who they‚Äôre trying to scam with that, majority of restaurants in Ireland won‚Äôt charge, and if they did, it might be 20 cent. Nowhere, not even in Dublin would a restaurant charge that. Going on previous reviews it seems that this is a theme of this restaurant. Won‚Äôt be back. (by Shane O'Connor) | Review 7: None - Sat in bar as was full but very comfortable.  Great food. Great views. Clean etc. Only downside there were no local beers for sale. (by E2133QMkevinm) | Review 8: None - Ok I've been here a few times.  3 strikes it gets worse every time.

Staff very friendly, place setup well to deal with  covid-19 spacing, hand sanitizing etc (by Lenny McCarthy) [5 years ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Excellent experience in Michaelangelos, first time here from Dublin. Beautiful decor and wonderful service, with an amazing view across the golf course. I ate the gambas prawns and steak (cooked to perfection) and enjoyed a mango daiquiri for dessert. I would 100% recommend this restaurant if your in the area or near by, definitely worth a spin from the surrounding area, lots of good food about Portnoo but this place is something special.

There's always something a little different to try like their homemade pink sauce - the kids went home to try to recreate it üòÅ  Not at all your regular chipper! (by Clare Barrett) [a year ago] | Review 6: 2 stars - They call themselves gourmet food truck, but they are in fact just chipper on wheels. Very average food in not the best location.

Fish and chips were tasty, but there was way too much chips and not enough fish. Burger was ok, fried chicken not so much as it wasn't fried for long enough to become crunchy. Coleslaw was terrible, probably the worst one I ever had with huge chunks of very old cabbage. None of the ingredients were impressive, seems like they are using low quality ones unfortunately.

Location is not the best, in the middle of a petrol station's car park with only a few seats available and surrounded with litter bins and disgusting smell coming from them.

Service was nice, portions were generous and prices were acceptable. (by Dragutin Cividini) [a year ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - I love this place, I make sure to visit every time Im in Donegal with the kids.
