Pimento,Carlow,"Kennedy Ave, Carlow, Ireland",Tapas restaurant,4.6,,,"Review 1: 5 stars - The food is amazing... No downside to it, can't fault it...
Everything is in between 7e-12e and portions are perfect...
They also do have a good sangria üòè (by Costin Rusu) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Foods are so delicious and considered one of the best tapas that I ever had ! Love the portion for sharing and worth to pay a visit (by Shwu Shiang Lim) [5 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Love the decor and atmosphere in Pimento. Their tables are organised in little booths which gives a lovely intimate dining vibe. Food is always delicious. We love to order various tapas and share each time we go. Caters for everyones tastes.
The last time we went was on a Monday and they have a great offer for two tapas and a drink for ‚Ç¨20. (by L Melay) [a year ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Very tasty, great service. (by Liam Fleming) [2 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Nice place to eat. Great selection of tapas. Good special offers midweek. Great for a group or just for chilled evening out with friends. (by Jack K) [a month ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Food was wonderful, great selection.
We were accommodated at short notice. Wait staff were extremely friendly and helpful.
Lovely atmosphere.
Would highly recommend. (by Rachel O'Neill) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 3 stars - A nice restaurant, with a relaxed atmosphere diminished by a loud local radio playing in the background. If you are going to the trouble of creating a tapas style restaurant why would you subject your patrons to a local radio station playing in the background which is mostly ads. It takes away from the food and visual experience. Otherwise very enjoyable. (by Brian F Kennedy) [3 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Everything was absolutely excellent, it was our second time here and we can‚Äôt wait for our next visit already. Each dish was so full of flavour and freshness, the extra detail to garnish the dishes were well constructed to complement each dish. The chowder was one of the best chowders we all have ever had in Ireland. The cheesecake was also light and delicious. We all really enjoyed the Portuguese win, especially our two Portuguese friends. Would definitely recommend dining here along with excellent food and drinks, the atmosphere and service were perfect. (by Niamh Mc) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 1 star - We came here on Sunday for the first time at 8:05pm and were waiting for a table but another staff came up and told up that the restaurant will be closed in 15 minutes. However, other staff & Google say that the closing time will be at 9pm but that staff definitely confirm the whole restaurant will be closed in 15 mins and showed a very bad, unacceptable attitude towards us by making noise while polishing folks and knife. Well we were so pissed off and left the place.
But we still give Pimento another chance to fix it because we think quality of the food must be considered as well.
I visited here the second time on Monday, the food were served very quick but I thought that tapas must be served one by one? The food gone cold very quick and most of the food were very salty.
The place has nice decorations and location but need improve in services. (by May) [Edited 2 years ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Simply amazing! Delicious food, great atmosphere, and friendly service.

Campagne,Carlow,"The Arches, 5 Gas House Ln, Gardens, Kilkenny, R95 X092, Ireland",Fine dining restaurant,4.7,,+353 56 777 2858,"Review 1: 4 stars - 3.5/5 Stars

While the meal was certainly pleasant, it fell short of the exceptional experience one might expect from a Michelin-starred establishment. At this level, I anticipate a notable attention to detail, a flair for creativity, and a consistent elevation in quality. Though the dishes were tasty, none stood out as truly remarkable. The scallop ravioli, however, was a standout: impeccably cooked, perfectly seasoned, and a testament to culinary precision. Unfortunately, the overall experience did not exude the elevated standard associated with Michelin recognition.
The cheese course, in particular, was a point of disappointment‚Äîlacking the sophistication one might hope for in such a setting.
As for the ambiance, the decor was adequate but unremarkable‚Äînothing that would leave a lasting impression or elevate the dining experience beyond the ordinary.
The service, unfortunately, did not align with the expectations one might have for a Michelin-starred venue. The staff, though friendly, lacked the polish and refinement that typically accompanies such an esteemed rating. Issues ranged from simple lapses, such as not remembering which dish belonged to which guest, to more noticeable oversights like failing to present the dessert wine menu before the cheese course, or even neglecting to refill water glasses. Additionally, dirty plates were left on the table for an extended period.
In summary, while the meal was enjoyable, the overall experience did not reflect the caliber typically associated with a Michelin star. There is potential here, but a more focused commitment to detail, both in the kitchen and front of house, is needed to truly distinguish this restaurant. (by Alex H) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Lovely fine dining experience and great food served, albeit not fantastically innovative (not in a bad way). Well curated wine list, and a crowd pleaser dessert menu. (by Zung Tran) [Edited 3 months ago] | Review 3: 3 stars - Food was fine...but for that price I expected more. Not exactly mind blowing flavour coming from any of the dishes. In addition, the waitress at the end asked me if I wanted to give a tip and stared at me as she held out the card machine...I'm sorry but that instantly makes me not want to tip you. (by Kevin) [2 weeks ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - A superb meal in relaxed surroundings. The food is beautiful French inspired cuisine where each dish is a delight. Thank you to the incredibly hard working Brid for the warm welcome and the friendly service.The early bird menu is amazing value. (by Ciaran Gordon) [Edited a year ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - My favourite restaurant in Ireland without exception. I honestly haven‚Äôt a single criticism from the multiple times we have tried the lunch and dinner menus. Great value for lunch and exceptional consistently tasty food. Ox cheek, Venison, leek ravioli, pheasant - all incredible. (by Chloe McGovern) [3 weeks ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - The food was nice, but the portions were very small. Staff were friendly but a little overly attentive. The price was a little over the top I was expecting the decor in this place to be top notch it was only ok, seats where not overly comfortable. Overall the experience was OK we had fun the night was made us having a laugh (by Jay Reilly) [11 months ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - This was a birthday treat for me and was my first time in a Michelin starred restaurant. We were running a little late for our booking and called ahead and it was no issue. The staff were so friendly and they were very attentive. The presentation of the food was amazing, such wonderful detail and lovely flavours, we had the early bird which was three courses for 48 euro each. We found this to be reasonable for the dining experience. The starter I had was our favourite dish of the night. Oxtail croquette served in lentils. One word ""beautiful"". I had lamb for mains and was a little underwhelmed, I didn't like the texture of the lamb and I wasn't a fan of the beans served with the dish but that could be just personal preference. The mash on the side was divine as smooth as silk and very rich and buttery. We ordered two sides cauliflower gratin and chips. Both lovely. I had the milk chocolate tart for dessert and again a little underwhelmed. I expected a nice chocolate taste but the flavour was more a burned caramel flavour. The texture was amazing though and again as smooth as silk. I would definitely go back again and would try something different on the menu. (by Margaret Lynch) [a year ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Very good experience - made it even better by the outstanding quality price ratio. Small and intimate venue is majestically run by few cordial staff members. The close by parking make the trip to the restaurant smooth and pleasant. Wine list is small but well curated and allows for many ‚Äúglass‚Äù options.

Special kudos for the lamb. Most of the menu has strong French influence leveraging beautiful Irish products.

Definitely a must if <100km away. (by Riccardo Amir Giulianelli) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Cannot say I‚Äôm a foodie. ‚Ä¶.. but I do enjoy food .

Visiting Kilkenny from Manchester, we definitely recommend this nice restaurant.

(by Yury Sapezhinsky) [2 years ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - The food was great, well made, good portions and well cooked food. I had a Peking duck which tasted good, the price was around 23 euro. The service and atmosphere where good, but not completely on point. The music was a bit off not matching the surrounding and the decor did not match the type of restaurant (in my opinion of course) it is still 4/5 because it was a clean and nice place. The service was also good, however the workers where stressing and planning orders around the table we where sitting. It believe this was because the computer system was placed in the middle of the room, which is not quite ideal. The waiters in general also seemed quite stressed, could be because they where about to be packed with reserved guests, but I am just rating based on what I experienced.
Overall food was great and the restaurant was nice. Would recommend going for some nice Chinese foods.

Incredible breakfast place, so tasty, great service and very friendly staff. We came here after getting some recommendations from friends and seeing reviews online and were definitely not excited.
We entered and were greeted by a member of staff to be told to take a seat while waiting for a table to become available. To avoid hanger, I quickly nipped over to the sister bakery across the road to get a pastry while we waited. My husband had been seated in the meantime and we ordered the Ube Pancakes and the Breakfast Sandwich. Both were incredibly flavoursome and would highly recommend this place to others. I enjoyed the fact that the menu changes every 8 weeks so that on our next visit we might have a completely different experience.
While paying I asked the server if she wouldn't mind filling our water bottle as it was the hottest day of the year outside and she obliged (ice and all!). Highly recommend this place and already can't wait to visit again. (by Emer Kelly) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Thank you so much for the amazing food we had today. It‚Äôs truly inspiring to see someone think about food in such a unique way and present it with this level of quality,especially here in Ireland.
We woke up early and drove more than three hours from Sligo, but it was absolutely worth it.ü´†
We look forward to visiting again soon!ü§òüèªüòã (by Kov√°cs G√°bor) [2 weeks ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - We had the most amazing lunch at Ar√°n today. The menu has plenty of offer and something for everyone. I went for the Buddha bowl which was 10/10 - everything was fresh and well thought out. I also sampled a little of the toasted special and it was delicious. So rare to talk about the bread being the best part of a sandwich because its so often overlooked but this bread was delicious.

So much so we went over the road to the bakery for a sourdough loaf to bring home. We also got some hot-cross buns and some cakes. The cakes were a real disappointment though as the carrot cake is either undercooked or looked like it had been previously frozen - either way it was stodgy and inedible. We only noticed when we got home so unfortunately it went into the bin.

Highly recommend the lunch but have a second look at the cakes before leaving. (by Ciaran McPhillips) [5 months ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - The perfect brunch spot, especially if you're coeliac!

From start to finish, Ar√°n was exactly what we needed on a bank holiday morning. We walked in and got a table straight away (such a win on a busy weekend), and the interior was so thoughtfully designed, everything from the layout to the little details felt aligned with the food and vibe.

One thing I really appreciated was how dog-friendly it is, even though we didn‚Äôt have ours with us. There‚Äôs a dedicated dog area, such a lovely touch!

The brunch menu had a great selection, and I nervously asked about the Ube French Toast, knowing I‚Äôm coeliac. I‚Äôve never had French toast at a caf√© before because places either can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt make it gluten free‚Ä¶ but the blonde server we had (I didn‚Äôt catch her name!) was so kind and understanding. We had a great chat about coeliac options as her sister is also gluten free, and she happily asked the chef for me. To my complete shock and delight, they made it gluten free with zero fuss.

And wow‚Ä¶ it was unreal. Ube cream cheese, syrup, strawberry compote, pistachios, it was so good it felt emotional! I felt like a kid on Christmas morning.

My boyfriend Joe got the breakfast sambo (which looked amazing) and we both had coffees too, you could tell even the drinks were made with intention. Everything felt curated to set you up for a great day.

This was my first time in Ar√°n but definitely not my last. Hands down the best brunch spot in Kilkenny. I don‚Äôt even need to check anywhere else! ü•∞‚ú® (by Susan Boyce) [a month ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Great restaurant/caf√© with very friendly waitresses & waiters.

The atmosphere of the place is really lovely and welcoming, the staff were friendly and attentive, and the whole experience felt genuinely special.

(by R√≠an √ì Lochlainn) [3 months ago] | Review 9: 1 star - I would give it 0 if I can , they served us Pork when we told we are vegetarians and proceeded to take the bill for other item.  To begin with , my husband and I are vegetarians and it‚Äôs for cultural reasons , while ordering we told them the same , we ordered UBE French toast and Korean potato pancake which were told is vegetarian .  UBE French toast although it looks pretty was very messy to eat as the rhubarb jam under it made the croissant extremely soggy . The problem was with Korean potato pancake which was served with Pork , which they didn‚Äôt check while serving and were only confirmed after we asked as it didn‚Äôt taste like tofu which they told us the vegetarian option . The lady said it‚Äôs human error as she forgot to save it as vegetarian ( I think that‚Äôs unacceptable as that‚Äôs the basic training one should have ) . If there‚Äôs someone allergic to something things like this can lead to fatal issue. A restaurant that claims to have gotten awards should make sure to double check the orders before they serve .

My wife, who is a pizza-lover and profoundly particular, said that this is one of the best pizzas that she has ever had.  Pizza was the perfect balance of thin crust & artisanal with the ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô amount of cheese & savory sauce.

Overall, strongly suggest this place for a celebration with the vegetarian in your life. (by Mason Marks) [3 weeks ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - I was happy to secure a table for 6pm on a Saturday night on the June bank holiday weekend and we were pleased that there was a 3 course weekend set menu on for ‚Ç¨33 per person. It was our first time here and we found staff pleasant and efficient without rushing you.
To start, we picked a satisfying bottle of Sangiovese di Puglia at ‚Ç¨32.
My husband opted for the Garlic bread with cheese and nduja with a smidgin of fresh salad leaves perfectly dressed. I got a few tasty morsels of this and was highly impressed and regretted my choice of the smoked trout millefoglie with carasau bread and stracciatella cheese even though it was very tasty indeed.
For mains, though I was tempted with the catch of the day oven baked cod, we both thought pasta the best bet in an Italian and we were not disappointed. I had the pasta with prawns and my husband had the chicken and chorizo pasta. The pasta brought me back to our meals in Italy and was as authentic as I have had.
To finish I had the Baileys tiramisu. It was so light and delicious but to be honest I didn't get a hint of Baileys in it. My husband chose the Crunchie cheesecake with crunchie icecream which was creamy, dreamy, flavourful and decadent.
This Italian has the portions and pacing of the meal down to a fine art in that by mains we thought we had space for dessert and by the end of dessert, we were at capacity.
We both would highly recommend for quality of food, value and atmosphere and hope to return in the future once a babysitter is lined up. Grazie.

With staff happy to see you every time.
So I walked in with a couple of guys,
And - really - joy lit up their eyes.

Not wanting to leave anything to chance,
I sent my order to you in advance.
A bit surprised by a slight grimace,
As he said: ""OK, it‚Äôll be 15 minutes.""

Fortunately, the time flew by fast,
And seeing your enthusiasm was a blast.
Mesmerised by the tall, handsome man,
Making pizza as best as he can.

My visit has left me craving more,
Oh, why hadn‚Äôt I tried you before?
With crust now running through my vein,
Don‚Äôt worry - you‚Äôll see me again.

So cheers to you, oh Domino‚Äôs team,
For turning pizza into a midnight dream.

(by Anthony Moran) [a week ago] | Review 3: 1 star - There is a parking for visual Carlow, but the problem is that you don't know how long it will take you to see the museum. The traffic wardens are constantly on the area, since the courts are across street: they even show up on Saturday looking for unfortunate people who cannot park anywhere else and come to Carlow to spend some time, do something fun at Visual and shopping while losing driving license points.

To make matters worse, the bartender refused to deliver the drinks to our table for no clear reason. What shocked me most was the poor hygiene: I witnessed her putting straws in her mouth before placing them in drinks, all while laughing and joking with her friends behind the bar.

He has restored much of the original features beautifully. There's a beautiful exposed red brick fireplace for cosy winter coffees. The furniture is in keeping with the caf√© and is very comfortable.  I asked for my Americano in a beautiful china cup and I took it outdoors to make the most of the last days of Summer. Brian gave me a little table and I read the fascinating history of the building and its place in Dublin Street. It's not often I get a chance to watch the world go by and I loved the atmosphere,  the excellent service, the decor and most importantly,  the coffee! I will be back and I have been spreading the word about my chance discovery. I will be back. I wish Brian all the best in his new venture.

Obviously it's gonna be cold if left overnight??? We had to drive in and give them back the food, to go elsewhere but no refund or apology or anything.

Was not impressed when I explained to him (very plainly, straightforward) that ""sorry, I don't do hands"", pretty much glared at me, he just about stopped himself from throwing his eyes to heaven. It was really poor show. He turned around to reach for the box of gloves, and it appeared he was trying to catch his co-workers eye at the same time. No one said anything by way of explanation, and it was clear I wasn't overly welcomed at the till thereafter! I do find that practice very odd in this day and age. Even if he'd washed his hands I'd be ok with that. The attitude said it all unfortunately.  Yeah I'd go back, quirky little spot, but I'd do the same again....I surely hope they don't; it was the attitude after I explained how uncomfortable felt that I really bugged me. I think they should know better. Before I was served, I had asked could I sit at their couch to eat, and the lady shrugged her shoulders and said yes, but at the till, that didn't feel like a comfortable option anymore.

Prawn crackers. They appear to rip off at ever opportunity. People in front of me asked for a spare box, they made them pay 30 cents for it, through the machine‚Ä¶why bother. I was then given a tiny bag of prawn crackers. Checked the order and told it was a mistake, given a bigger bag‚Ä¶food is fine, but charging the same for takeaway as a dine-in makes no sense. Only one table with any guests and I imagine annoying for them as  people come in to collect takeaway. Just a rip off, trying to gouge at every chance I‚Äôve seen, and food is only fine.

It was cold over cooked, got lamb rogan Josh and a coconut beef curry, a few bit of meat and a consistency of liquid. In the beef curry. No veg no thick sauce disgusting. Veg pakora and chips were over cooked. Everything was cold and ordered through Uber eats, it was late We had to try and heat the chips and burnt pakora in the air fryer . I‚Äôm so disappointed.

The pilau rice was half boiled and half pilau for both of us, the onion bhajis were burned and overcooked, the garlic mushrooms were tasteless and both main courses had very watery and salty sauces.

(by Allie lumme) [6 months ago] | Review 5: 3 stars - Food was great but the service quite appalling.  Like, how hard is it to serve the only three tables that were dining, I wonder what is the experience like when all tables are occupied, I doubt it ever does with such behaviour. Lack of staff attending tables or even caring if the customer wants anything. Just hiding behind the desk and kitchen doesn't run a restaurant!! Also if you don't have some items in the menu then don't have it in the menu. It didn't look like staff wanted to serve people. Server not familiar with menu not asking if the dishes are to be prepared mild or hot or normal. After finishing eating we literally had to wait for more than 25 minutes and no one would even come out to see if we need anything or we want to pay the bill etc. Another surprise is when another customer came in at exactly an hour or 55 mins before closure and they said they will do only take away and not dine in. It was crazy to think that a restaurant who are not at all busy and has a sparse footfall will do this !! The two stars although are only because the food was good, not super good but just good. (by R V) [Edited 2 years ago] | Review 6: 1 star - Ridiculous service here. Ordered at 6:30, food wasn‚Äôt delivered till 8pm, when food was eventually delivered the order was wrong!

The only downfall for the restaurant is the wait time. I've had 2 collections, each time I was told 20 minutes of a wait time which turned out to be over an hour.

The wait time is a put off. If they just told you the time it was going to take it wouldn't be as frustrating.

However this time it was only mediocre.  The onion rings were tasteless and over cooked.  The battered burger was also overcooked and the batter was hard on one side it was like glass shards when bitten into.  The burger and chips were on the lower side of tasty.

Upon discussion of our food, we realised there were different staff there, so perhaps it has changed owners and they do not have the cooking skills of the previous staff.

I've been away from kilkenny for a few months. And something went terribly downhill, In those few months, I had the chargriled chiken skewers.

Threw the whole thing to trash. Tried calling to complain, but no one bothered to answer. I hope the manager or owner sees this was overwhelming disappointing!

He then suggested the bubble drink and it was yep..I absolutely loved it! My son had the tacos which he 'inhaled'..was the best time ever and definitely...I will let my friends (we're all on the well seasoned 60+ side) know and ofcourse it will snowball from there!! ü§óüíÉ

(by Lauren B) [a year ago] | Review 7: 1 star - Went to namo carlow for a takeaway was charged 23.70 for a pulled pork burrito and wedges tapped my card and left after a minute I thought about it and was overcharged. Walked back in the door and told the guy I'd been over charged. Handed him my receipt he told me he would refund me. He done the refund on the card machine on the screen the amount was 0.01 I knew this was wrong and tapped for the refund anyway, I asked the guy for my receipt he wouldn't give it to me he then handed me 7 euros in cash. He would have left me on with a 1 cent refund had I not asked for the receipt. Guys be careful. The burrito it's self was less than average very little pork filling. I wouldn't return again as they were going to do me only I asked for my receipts. I wouldn't recommend much nicer spots to eat for less money with out getting screwed.

The regular burger was regular, but for me, it was okay. My friend couldn‚Äôt eat it. The philly steak, however, blew our senses. It has little to do with authentic philly steak, but what this place offers is beyond expectations. They serve it in a ciabatta, the cheese they use matches so well with the meat and the grilled vegetables at the same time, that on our way home we were talking about the complexity of its taste for a while. It was a delight.

Tom the owner, was super friendly and always helpful. Breakfast options were broad, and you won't go away hungry.

We visited without a car, and the train station and downtown Carlow are a bit of a walk but totally doable for anyone without mobility issues.

Will definitely stay at the Avalon if we return to the area. (by Brian Loney) | Review 3: None - We stayed at Avlon House while visiting my daughter at Carlow College (St. Patrick's). The room was spacious for the two of us to share but easily had room enough for three people. It felt like home with a modern bathroom and comfortable beds. The house is quiet during the day and very little noise heard from the street outside at night. The host was welcoming, gracious and provided helpful information about the many beautiful sights in and outside of Carlow. The breakfast offerings we chose each night for the next day were delicious and served personally by the host.  We mainly walked to get around. The Carlow Train Station (13-minutes), Carlow Coach Park bus station (16-minutes) and Carlow College (17-minutes) were an easy walk from Avon House on even ground and the routes were extremely well-lit at night. I highly recommend Avlon House for comfortable lodging, a kind and helpful host and a convenient location.

To put it simply, the nearly 5-star review average is well-earned! The location can't be beat: it's so easy to walk to the town center and have your choice of restaurants. Tom gave us some great recommendations too. Off-street parking was ample, and everything about our stay was just what we imagined and wanted in an Irish bed and breakfast.

I wanted something health but yet tasty.
I was greeting with a warm smile from the person behind the counter. She gave me time to make my decision and ask if I needed any help as I was shocked by the amount of choice on offer.
She kindly talked me through the menu, I explained I wanted something health but yet tasty.
She suggested a Massaman Curry with chicken and brown rice.
IT WAS AMAZING. It was so tasty and full of flavor.
I'm not sure what I was expecting from a service station restaurant but it surpassed all my expectations.
I'll definitely be stopping again on my way down to Carlow and I might even drive out of my way to try another one of their dishes. (by Joyce O Neill) [2 years ago] | Review 8: 3 stars - Limited veg options. Thai vegan curry was good but the vegan pad prik Haeng was too salty, they had just drenched it in soy sauce and wasnt good. (by Pragya) [a year ago] | Review 9: 1 star - Was looking forward to a quality meal to take home but was staff were breaking down the kitchen in Petite Camile just before 8pm. The Google details says it's open to 9pm every evening but the lady serving said I had one minute to order as it was 7.59pm. I said I thought it was 9pm but she didn't care. A brand damaging and poor customer experience. If closing at 8 on a Saturday night in December is normal fair enough. But print it on your page. Very poor experience. Plenty of better local options in carlow. Definitely not recommended. (by Conor Molloy) [2 years ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Kids portion was so spicy even adult couldn't eat that

The rack of ribs were perfect : juicy and full of flavoursome meat, and marinated in a beautiful stick sauce, they were delicious.

The wings were crispy on the outside and beautifully moist in the middle. I'm not normally a wings fan, but these have converted me.

We also had the pork sliders and the burger. Both were of a standard that was really good. Both were full of flavour and very moreish, but by now we were stuffed and happy. We will have to leave more room next time to really appreciate them. (by Richard Kavanagh) [2 years ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Been here twice. Lovely atmosphere and decor. Food is nice.

If you have mobility issues, specify you need seating in the front bar as most of the seating in the place is via a maze of stairs. . It was very crowded, tables a little too close together.

(by Jenny Hanlon) [3 years ago] | Review 7: 1 star - Very disappointing,  the bar is lovely, nice atmosphere  and the lady at the front of house was pleasant . Menu was not great, not much choice. Lacked imagination.   The portions were smaller than the average portions. It has alot of potential with the right staff, including the kitchen which was very very poor on the delivery of meals. One of the waiters was extremely unprofessional and was very abrupt and flippant in his reply to our query. Then when the bill arrived we were charged for something we didn't receive in our order.

Butcher Restaurant,Carlow,"The Butterslip, St Kieran's St, Gardens, Kilkenny, R95 T3VX, Ireland",Steak house,4.7,,+353 56 779 0655,"Review 1: 5 stars - Step into the cozy, homey haven of Butcher, where every bite tells a story! This charming gem of a restaurant is owned by Matt, a passionate cow farmer who raises 250 head of Hereford and Angus beef right here in the local fields. No hormones, no water-pumped fluff‚Äîjust pure, grass-fed goodness butchered on-site. Matt spent a delightful 10 minutes at our table, sharing how he went from selling his premium beef to the previous owner to impulsively taking the reins himself. His mission? To serve honest, high-quality beef that shuns the bloated, hormone-heavy cuts flooding American menus. It‚Äôs all about flavor over flash here, with a nod to classic home cooking.
The vibes are warm, the sides are playful, and the cocktails? Absolute perfection. You have to order the ‚ÄúCowboy,‚Äù a jaw-dropping 14oz bone-in rib eye that‚Äôs pure melt-in-your-mouth magic. Service strikes the perfect balance‚Äîswift but never rushed. Look up, and you‚Äôll spot the quirky cow bars lining the ceiling, a nod to Matt‚Äôs inspiration from another U.S. restaurant, now adorned with hooks holding twinkling lights instead of meat.
Don‚Äôt sleep on this hidden treasure‚ÄîButcher‚Äôs prices are as reasonable as its portions are generous. Trust me, this is a dining experience you won‚Äôt forget!

The ribs were absolutely divine ‚Äî fall-off-the-bone tender! The vegetables were grilled over the same fire as the meat, giving them a smoky, meaty flavor ‚Äî just perfect.

(by Christina Ripley) [a month ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - We recently visited Churrascaria o Galo, a Portuguese restaurant in Carlow. The staff were very polite, and the service was excellent.

We ordered the classic burger and a crazy beef side. The portion size was huge ‚Äì with the crazy beef side alone, there‚Äôs really no need for a starter or main course. Great value if you‚Äôre hungry!

The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, and the decor had a nice Portuguese touch, which added to the charm. It‚Äôs also a kid-friendly place ‚Äì they even offer painting activities for children, which is a thoughtful bonus for families.

That said, the food itself didn‚Äôt feel very Portuguese. More traditional Portuguese dishes or flavors would help match the theme better.

Also, a small thing to note ‚Äì they charge ‚Ç¨2 extra for mayonnaise with the burger. Usually, one dip is included without an extra fee.

Veg on New Year Eve left  a lot to be desired and the following evening early in the evening there was already 3 items unavailable.   I would expect someone like that late in the evening.   Also frozen chips were served not what was advertised on the Menu and when I ordered I made the point of making it clear that I wouldn't accept frozen chips but still arrived with them.   I also felt my complaint was listen to but nothing offered as compensation not even a drink but overall apart from that the rooms, staff and everything else in the hotel was good (by Maria Reid) [a year ago] | Review 4: 2 stars - Dry food, not tasty and too salty‚Ä¶.

Opens Saturday and Sunday from 12 and last orders are 730
We ordered starters and main but never received starters üò¢

The waitress checked up on us from time to time which is great and they were very kind to us

The food has been delivered to us very quickly so I am pleased with the service

I ordered some Chicken wings and chips and loved every bit of it, however the reason why I gave it four instead of five is because Since the Chicken wings get Soaked in Barbeque sauce it gets rather messy when you pick it up and eat with your hands.
Next time please give more Napkins since it took 4 napkins (I only got 2 at the start and had to ask my friend for theirs)
for me to get the Sauce all off me.

Other than that it is a really good pub to go to and I really enjoyed it there! (by Nicole Dzhungurova (Nikol)) [2 years ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Beautiful pub.

We haven‚Äôt ordered in a while and we won‚Äôt again. The spice bags had few tiny pieces of chicken and came with no dips. The kebabs was like piece of rubber and tasted like plastic. Waited ages to collect our order even though it says it was ready. Staff was rude and we felt a bad vibes in the waiting area.

When asking about any of above mentioned the staff was incredibly rude, we have been here a lot in the past and have had no issues with anything so it was quite disappointing.

Ordered a signature burger which were delicious, but this time it came with a soggy red coloured bun. Tasted of antiseptic and left a horrible taste in my mouth for ages.
Called them to complain and they said that's the bun that's used now in the signature burger and sorry but some people like it.

But these new employees have changed the entire experience. Me and a couple of friends went to go dine in and order A bag of chips, The SECOND we walked in to go sit down and look up at the menu -"" GUYS GET OUT U NEED TO ORDER SOMETHING TO SIT IN"" One of my friends ordered chips but yet they still continued to shout as us as EVERYONE

There is a small play area for young children in the restaurant part which is handy. I only gave it 3 stars because the bathroom was filthy and we had to use dish soap to wash our hands in. The floor in the bathroom had puddles everywhere and my daughter kept asking who peed on the floor. While in the restaurant part there was nothing to tackle the amount of flies and bugs. Where we were sitting there were 5 wasps and 1 bee and an uncountable amount of flies. It's a slight turn off to see that. However, over at the counter where the kitchen is was a medium blue light zapper. Is gusto is fine for take aways but the only reason I sit in is so my child can use the play area. To be honest, once the other take away re-opens I won't be going back to is gusto. (by Joanne Keena) [7 years ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Absolutely appalling customer service!! And food is gone terrible!
I specifically rang the shop and asked for salt and vinegar on my meal because when I order it on just eat they ignore the comment box and always send the order up without salt and vinegar. So after I had rang the shop with my order and it got delivered the order was still wrong so I rang the shop and the man had a smart attitude over the phone and said next time he will put twice as much! Then agreed to send a fresh order down and after waiting 1.5 hours order never showed up so I had to drive to the chipper myself with my order and I was told the order wasn't put back out for delive and I was told to shut up when I was trying to speak! I have ordered here a lot and I will not be ordering again! Reheated chips, kebab trays and garlic chips+cheese trays are gone half the size to what they used to be and still full price! I never leave bad feedback but I am absolutely disgusted!!!

Ordered for delivery for the fist time today and was very happy with our meal.  The crispy chicken was really chunky and super moist and the rice was lovely and fluffy; the duck was nice a crispy and not chewy at all.

All if it was delicious and I would definitely get it all again.

One thing thats worth sharing as well, I thought I got the wrong meal (hot garlic chicken) as it was sweet and had a brown sauce, which is different than I've had before in other Chinese takeaways.  So I called just to let them know I got the wrong order.  The girl who answered was lovely, apologetic and polite, which is tough in an awkward situation when working in customer service.  Then the manager came onto the phone to give a refund, she was also super friendly and apologetic.  It actually turned out that their version of hot garlic is sweet, so I said I'd give it a go and did not take the refund.  It was delicious and I'd buy it again, so I was happy!

Overall, the food was delicious and hot, and the staff were lovely!  üôÇ (by Lisa Finegan) [2 years ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Ribs were just pure fat and bones. Every cause was stinking of vinegar.

Table service made ordering drinks easy, however ordered my last drink over 20mins before close (as per screenshot); had to go into the barman 2 mins before 10pm as the drink never came to the table.

Barman had a face like he swallowed a wasp when I asked for the drink having told him I ordered 20 mins ago‚Ä¶ He had a drop of gin left in the bottle and didn‚Äôt bother to open a new one so it was mostly mixer in the drink, bit slap dash.

Make sure to order final drinks well before close. (by Joe Balfe) [3 months ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Sullivan‚Äôs it‚Äôs a dog friendly bar, they have live Irish music, amazing food and of course a good variety of beers.

(by Al M) [10 months ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - Been ordering from Kung Fu for years but last night I was so disappointed with my food. Ordered a satay noodle box with king prawn but the sauce was extremely watery and tasteless. Normally it‚Äôs thick with chunks of peanuts throughout but this sauce was almost like a strange broth at the bottom of my noodle box, with almost no flavour to it at all. Vegetables also tasted a little off, they didn‚Äôt seem fresh, broccoli was very mushy. Also ordered a portion of chicken balls with sweet and sour sauce but was disappointed with the size of them, they were more like chicken nuggets and were sopping with grease. The sweet and sour sauce also had a strange jelly like consistency, which was quite off putting. I‚Äôm not sure I would order from here again, quite sad as normally this is my to-go spot for a Chinese, sorry. (by Erin Flood) [9 months ago] | Review 4: 1 star - I am absolutely disgusted,
I wasn't even In the door and I felt unsafe and as a young girl that is no good, had to ask my dad to come in with me!! The vibe was horrible, we used to eat here all the time before we found a better place but it was closed today so we went here. I ordered a spicebag, spring rolls and satay sauce and let me tell you I won't be ordering it again!! Let me start with the spring rolls,There was so little in the bag and they definitely where not fresh nor where they a good size. Onto the sauce, for a peanut sauce it had no peanut esscenes in it. Not even a hint of it, and such a small container it was gone before I even finished half the bag. Lastly I'd like to talk about the spice bag. Used to get it here all the time and the portions used to be huge and it was so delicious however. Times have clearly changed! The chicken was stringy and dry, the batter for the chicken had a weird after taste of achohol and the seasoning was definitely not a saving grace for this meal. The chips where soggy and had the same woeful seasoning as the chicken and the vegetables (or lack there of) was appalling. I understand some people don't like the veg as much as the chicken and chips but onions and decently sized carrots are a must in a good spice bag. I have to say that I won't won't going here again nor will mu family and friends, I leave this review sad, slightly scared and feeling ill from the food.

Its a euro i have no problem with that, my problem is the fact your establishment thinks its perfectly acceptable to over charge people, that's one person, if you do 20 deliveries in the one night that's 20 extra in your pockets for FALSE ADVERTISMENT AND OVER PRICING.

Petronella,Carlow,"Butter Slip lane, Co. Kilkenny, Ireland",Modern European restaurant,4.7,,+353 56 776 1899,"Review 1: 5 stars - What an absolute gem of a restaurant in Kilkenny. Make sure you make a reservation in advance!
The rib roast dinner I had was one of the best meals I have ever had! My terms of reference for this statement comes from extensive travels throughout the world.
There is a very deep history with the location of Petronella and the ambiance is so warm and inviting.
Finally, the service was excellent! (by Malcolm Gurley) [5 days ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - I had a lovely lunch here in Kilkenny. We started with the pork belly croquettes, which were excellent; the meat was perfectly tender and shredded, and the homemade sauces complemented them really well. For the main course, I had the cottage pie, which was also delicious and full of flavor. The interior is beautifully decorated, with exposed stone and a charming medieval atmosphere that really adds to the experience. On top of that, the staff were very welcoming and genuinely kind. A great spot for lunch, highly recommended! (by Nicolas Fischer) [a month ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Great food. Everything was really good and no complaints at all.

The endive starter salad and Burrata cheese appetizers were great.  The main dishes were truly the stars of the meal.  I had the chicken, and the vegetables that came with the plate were out of this world.  The broccoli and carrots that came with this meal were hands down some of the best I‚Äôve ever had.  I only wish this dish came with the mash potatoes that came with my husband‚Äôs short ribs!  Overall the service was great.  The ambience was phenomenal as well.  Highly recommend. (by Rebekkah Merrell) [2 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - The atmosphere with great jazz music and antiques make for the start of a great experience that is topped by excellent food and the kindest owner and staff.

A few weeks ago I entered the restaurant just before closing. I was served by a lovely girl called Rachel. I asked if there were any cookies left. She took a look and said there were 2. I said I'd love to have them thanks. A manager in the vicinity commented that I was very nice and told me I was probably their customer of the day. Which I found very nice. As Rachel was grabbing me my cookies, she said that a few more just became available and asked me if I'd like some more. I said I'd take another 2 if possible please. So she handed me 4 cookies. I grabbed my card to pay but she told me that it was okay I could have the other 2 for no extra charge. She wished me a wonderful rest of my night then.

If you're lucky to get the good staff (and if you choose a less busy hour), the food here can be very good and well-sized, although still a bit price-y.

I usually get a large Taco Chip when in here, and as already stated, it can be very hit-or-miss. For 6.50, you can either get a proper massive box of the stuff, or you get a sad little fry box.

If you feel like gambling 6.50 for a Taco Chip (or something else on the menu), this place is recommended.

I had Hereford beef on sourdough bread which was gorgeous and we were so engrossed chatting I dimly remember my friend's meal - definitely vegetarian with gluten free wrap, which she ate all of. Then for dessert I had the crumble and she had lemon cheesecake- gorgeous.  My coffee was lovely too. Staff excellent and patient. Toilets clean and I was happy to see sanitiser on the wall on the way out. My only gripe is the distance to the carpark as I have mobility issues, but thankfully there were no steps to tackle. (by Loraine Delaney) [2 years ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - We have had multiple events and family meals in Lennons. It never fails to impress. The food, staff, attention to detail and a fabulous setting make it a special place. Carlow is lucky to have such a restaurant. (by Ivor O'Loughlin) [10 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - We visited for lunch with my aged mother10 days ago (remiss of me not to post until now!) and we were very impressed with the menu and the service.  It's also a great location and the busyness during a midweek lunch period is testament to the overall experience. (by Chris Robinson) [a year ago] | Review 6: 3 stars - This just my view. While in a party of 8, this is a solo observation.
The flavours were superb. I had the duck croutons for starters.  There were 3 croutons, each about the size of a dice... eh I'm a big lad,  that was nearly 1 bite.
Haddock with prawns and mussels main.  Again superb taste, a piece of fish 3 inches square,  1 prawn, 3 mussels. Some Nash and green beans.
The starter was ‚Ç¨15, the main ‚Ç¨34. Bottle of OK wine ‚Ç¨47.
I went home and had last night's leftovers.
In short, in my sole opinion,  treat your taste buds on a special occasion,  but have your dinner before you go if you have a decent appetite. (by Brian Darcy) [7 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - I forgot just how good Lennons is for evening dining. A group of 4 all different starters and mains and all beyond delicious.

It was particularly sunny hot weather which made the rooms extremely hot and uncomfortable especially when trying to sleep. As it is located very town centre do great to get to places but also right beside a pub..... it's very loud.... and the people don't care as they stop and talk and argue right at your window..... the windows have to be open as its so incredibly hot...... so no sleep at all..... also other people staying here leave the doors to shut themselves and trust me they slam!

(by Heather Humphries) | Review 3: None - I went down to the pub to have a drink or 2 with my boyfriend and his brother and to play a few games of pool. As soon as we walked in we could smell weed but didn‚Äôt think anything of it. When we walked in the bartender (the same person who served us 2 days prior) told us he will not serve us because we are smoking weed. I told him feel free to come around and see if he can smell anything off me and he refused. He kicked us out after we did nothing wrong. I then went back in alone to try and talk to him and he said multiple times ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not blaming you, I‚Äôm not blaming you‚Äù insinuating that he was blaming one of the two men rather than the woman. In my opinion I think that is very sexist. One he was incorrect and two he repeated sexist remarks. Yes it is not a huge deal but all we wanted was to play a few games of pool as it is difficult to find a pub with a pool table locally. I understand he has a right to remove us if that‚Äôs what he believes but he had no interest in investigating further. He could have came around the side of the bar and quickly realized it was not us or even checked the cameras as we were accused of smoking there and then.

He was also quick to assume it was the men smoking instead of the woman. We got kicked out for absolutely no reason at all and judged and embarrassed.

Check out is done by depositing the key into a box on the wall just inside the main door. The lock is activated automatically and you need to hold a keyfob to unlock.

Billies Grill and Chinese Restaurant - Coffee House,Carlow,"1 Kennedy St, Carlow, R93 C2R7, Ireland",Restaurant,4.2,,+353 59 917 6257,"Review 1: 4 stars - Review Date: 25 SEP 2025
The only Halal restaurant in town that offers chinese, grill, and takeaway style kebabs/doner options.

I tried chef special chow mein which was ok, but runny, which was a usual twist.

On another occasion I ordered Half grilled chicken platter. grilling was perfect but chicken had almost no taste. Still, with the crispy skin and absolutely gorgeous fries it dis the job.

The salad on the other hand killed the joy as it appeared to be straight out of Tesco salad bag stored overnight. I think either you serve fresh salad or completely skip it otherwise it will ruin everything.

I found the service to be dull although it wasn‚Äôt busy on both of the occasions.

Still, i will keep going back as we have very limited options in town (by Omer Ali) [5 days ago] | Review 2: 2 stars - Do not order Chinese food in this restaurant.

Such a quaint and delightful city I am proud to call my home. I have been to every single cafe and establishment that serves beverages and items of consumption and in all of my days and and nights (some of them sleepless as I ponder the meaning of life), I can say with my hand on heart and my eyes full of hope, this cafe is nice. I was served by a sensational and easy going waitress. I felt that she was emotionally invested in my meal and my experience at the caf√®.

Excellent latte , with fresh out of the oven scone.

Highly recommend. (by Barry Sullivan) [a month ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - The food here can be really hit or miss. For instance today I ordered the porridge but got served it with a different milk than I had previously asked for with the porridge and wasn‚Äôt told they had ran out of berry compote and instead just got served a spoon of jam on top, while last week I ordered the exact same thing and it was exquisite. The same can be said for the pancakes, sometimes they‚Äôre cooked to perfection and sometimes they‚Äôre a little burnt. The food is a little slow coming out which I don‚Äôt mind on the days the foods amazing because I can appreciate that it‚Äôs freshly made. I will stay that the staff are amazing and friendly and I‚Äôm always greeted with a smile whenever I go on. A young man who waits (I think he‚Äôs named Clayton I could be wrong) is extremely friendly and definitely an amazing attribute to the cafe.

First cup was supposed to be black but it looked like weak tea with no milk  you could see the bottom of the cup it was that weak. Second cup looked like a cup of tea with milk not much to taste there either.
But kids did like the ribena.
Overall I felt like I just wasted my hard earned cash. We didn't drink them. The van looks great and inviting.  But the best advice I can give on my experience iis to walk past and go to Costa or tesco  at least you can taste there coffee. I would have went back only we were on the road.

August came and I was notified my furniture had landed in Carlow and was due to be dispatched within 3-7 working days. These days past so I called customer service, after a long wait and a pleasant conversation I was reassured that my furniture would be on the next delivery out. I waited again, still no sign. I sent many emails and again received pleasant replies from different members of the customer service team, always reassuring me that they were doing their very best. I finally asked for a refund on September 4th when I felt I could no longer believe what I was being told regarding my delivery. Again I was forced to send many emails regarding my refund as I had not received the money or confirmation that it had been processed. I have lost count of the interactions I've had with the Rathwood customer service team. As time went on it took longer for replies. I was told on the 20th of September that my refund would be processed rapidly. Today, the 29th of September I was forced to go against my nature and have a very angry phone call with the Rathwood customer service team. I was upset I was forced to do this but I was on the brink of legal action as this goes against consumer rights act 2022 section 31.
This experience has truly been awful, distressing and beyond dissapointing. To think that this company can get away with this behaviour is just so upsetting. Please go elsewhere (by lisa glynn) [3 days ago] | Review 5: 1 star - Unfortunately,  I wasn't able to leave zero stars.
I'm still waiting to be reimbursed a significant sum for firewood purchased in March which was not delivered.Very disappointed that Rathwood are not refunding my money and have been ignoring my emails. So after six months, I have neither my money - nor the firewood. Strange way to run a business; anyone else having this experience? (by S. Irwin) [6 days ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - I had a very positive experience with Faye in Rathwood. She went over and beyond to help me in getting a replacement part for a parasol after it was damaged by the wind. Despite this being outside the products warranty, Faye went out of her way to source a replacement piece and for it to be sent out by courier. I would rate my customer experience in Rathwood highly. Thank you Faye. 5 star service. (by Theresa Clare) [a week ago] | Review 7: 1 star - I purchased a bed on September 4
I purchased a bed on September 4, 2025, and received order confirmation immediately after paying for the product, including shipping. On September 9, 2025, I contacted Rathwood via their website to find out the estimated delivery date, and the response was: ""Thanks for getting in touch. Stocks are from our UK warehouse. Once they arrive at the Ireland warehouse, typically every Wednesday, they will be promptly prepared for dispatch, which usually takes 5 to 10 working days."" Okay, I waited until September 25, 2025, and asked again about the delivery, since they hadn't sent me any update. AGAIN, THE SAME RESPONSE: ""Hello Guilherme, Thanks for getting in touch. Stocks are from our UK warehouse. Once they arrive at the Ireland warehouse, typically every Wednesday, they will be promptly prepared for dispatch, which usually takes 5 to 10 working days. Once arrived at the warehouse, the courier will be in touch via text message for the delivery date, and you'll have the opportunity to accept or rearrange."" This is disrespectful to the customer and disrespectful of our time and money, as they don't position us correctly. Not to mention that there's an order update like this: September 19, 2025
Order was canceled. CANCELLED BY WHOM? No one contacted me or gave me a refund. No explanation, just the same bizarre response. (by Guilherme de Souza Lopez) [4 days ago] | Review 8: 1 star - Ordered on Wait and Save scheme in May to receive outdoor furniture in July. However dates were getting pushed back until end of September so I decided to cancel that order and order furniture in stock. I was told 3-5 working day delivery. I am still waiting.
I must admit I used to love Rathwood furniture but never again.
It has even put me off the Christmas and Halloween events due to the bad experience.
Such a shame as this place used to be great. (by Emma Brett) [a week ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Fantastic food, waiting staff and very clean place.
Portion of the lunch menu is incredible.  You cannot say I have spend to much. The Roast beef was delicious,  the gravy is not like all restaurant make from powder.  Very tasty gravy sauce.  Very soft slow cooked beef.
Chicken oven baked,  juicy and tender.  Stuffing was very good as well. Mashed potatoes fresh and. Water taste like a water, no chlorine smell or taste so must be filtered and big credit for that. Juice was also in good price.  Chefs special which was chicken only ‚Ç¨14.50
Thank you for good food. Best regards (by Lukasz Smetek) [3 months ago] | Review 10: 2 stars - Ordered garden furniture in April on a scheme they call pay and wait . I paid in full and was told I‚Äôd get furniture in early June . Unfortunately they kept changing delivery dates and I still hadn‚Äôt received furniture early  August and was then told it would be September ( üòÇ summer over ) . I cancelled order  and was told it would be 14 days for refund . I dealt with Reine and I always got a reply from her regarding updates . I got fully refunded on 20th August . I have bought many times from Rathwood but never experienced this delay ever . If you can wait months for goods ( which in fairness are of high standard) to be delivered then order from them if not go elsewhere .

Rive Gauche Kilkenny,Carlow,"2 The Parade, Gardens, Kilkenny, Ireland",Irish restaurant,4.6,,+353 56 777 5604,"Review 1: 5 stars - I looooved this restaurant a lot. Wasn't expecting to find a jewel in Kilkenny from the get go. It was a random choice and such a lucky one. The food was a delight. Not only tasty, but artistically arranged. The staff is helpful, attentive and at the same time not distracting you from enjoying the food - nice balance here. And atmosphere is a separate joy. If I could, I would have given 6 starsüòÅ. Fancy, darkish, stylish, tasteful.
Pricing a bit on a high-medium side (about 50‚Ç¨ per person), but you expect that from a good restaurant.
Lovely evening in a lovely place. And a definite recommendation for those, who visit Kilkenny. (by Yuliia Kravchuk) [2 weeks ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - We live in Kilkenny and this is our favourite restaurant. We have had family dinners (with teens), meeting friends and meals just as a couple - all wonderful. The food is lovely, great wine selection. The decor makes me feel like I am in Paris but it‚Äôs the fabulous service that keeps us coming back time and time again. Everyone there is so attentive, friendly and professional. Tvrtko (hoping I spelled this correctly) in particular is a gentleman and looks after us so well every time we are there. Highly recommend. (by Sarah West Keogh) [a week ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - Enjoyed the ambiance and service- the food was pretty good, although the steak was quite tough and less than good.

Very nice place and grounds. (by Karl Brandt) [a year ago] | Review 9: 3 stars - During our 3 weeks vacation in Ireland  last June of this year, 2022, some relatives of my wife treated us for a dinner at the Clashganny House Restaurant near Borris, County Carlow. We visited this place, Friday evening, 9 PM, 17th of June. One enters a small entrance & reception hall. To the right is the dining room, quite small but cozy. We had a table for 9 persons which was placed near the door. Once seated, it took a long time before our orders were taken. I did not fancy any starter but my wife had the tomatoe soup of the day which she thought was good. I ordered & got Pan Fried Skate Fish. The fish tasted good. It was fried without any flour coating, had a crab-meat-like texture, nutty flavor, low in salt, lacked a little taste of lemon & had a little melted butter as sauce. It was served with fried asparagus, a small tomatoe & a couple of fried prawns, together with fried potatoe bits & boiled broccoli. I had a glass of white wine with the meal. Lastly, we had coffee & dessert, I had warm Chocolate Fondant served with a scoup of Chocolate Ice Cream, with streaks of chocolate sauce. It was quite an enjoyable dinner with relatives. Highly recommendable. (by Alfonso Silverio) [3 years ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - We had a lovely meal here after adventuring on the Barrow for a few hours.

The food here was, without a doubt, the best Thai food I'd ever tasted. Needless to say, I've been to quite a few over the years. This dining experience was made more special by the warm hospitality of the staff, one of whom a young lady was very attentive and even  made us a list of great restaurants to dine in in London.

Also we came on a tour and it took so long to get our food that we didn't have time to browse the town or castle before leaving. My husband got the burger and it was flavourless and thin.

Lovely place. Staff amazing. Very friendly and quick turn around. The only thing for me ... the steak didnt seem to wow me. It was cooked to my liking but didnt taste tge price ... the mash and veg and sauce is lovely though (by Dorans Photos) [4 months ago] | Review 4: 3 stars - This restaurant was recommended by our taxi driver and a local walking on the street, so we were really excited to try it. The experience started with a 30-minute wait for a table, which we spent in the bar (to be fair, we had just arrived in the city and didn't book beforehand). There was live music by a guy playing the guitar, and while his music choice and guitar playing were great, he changed the tunes of the songs quite a bit, which wasn‚Äôt to my liking.

Once seated, the service was excellent. The waiters were very nice and respectful. I ordered the Paris Texas Lemonade, the pork ribs with whiskey sauce, and the steak fajitas. The drinks and the appetizers were fantastic, and we were really enjoying our meal until the main course arrived. Unfortunately, the steak was too dry and burnt, and the onions were overcooked to the point of being black. I couldn‚Äôt finish my plate because it was disappointing. The condiments were okay, though I didn't particularly enjoy the bell pepper in the guacamole. For a main dish priced at 22 euros, I really expected more.

I did inform the waitress about the issue, and they graciously took the steak off the bill, which I appreciated.

Overall, the staff, the ambiance and the appetizers were great, but the disappointing main course brought down the experience. With a few adjustments, this place has the potential to be fantastic. (by Muriel A) [a year ago] | Review 5: 2 stars - Definitly not a great place for any kind of American BBQ. Mediocre Irish pub food at best. All was prepared well in advance, bland and dry, we could had better burger in Burger King. Ribs have been dry, rock hard and burned, coted with strange sweet sauce to cover it all. Wings just plain and probably from day before. Pulled pork was only good thing, brisket horrible, all was covered with deep fried shredded onion that was gross. Staff great and ambient is nice.

I had the crispy fried chicken. It wasn't that crispy but the seasoning had a bit of a Cajun kick to it. It was pretty good despite it not being that crispy. I got it with the hot sauce they use for wings (on the side) I'd recommend it. My Mac and cheese and beans weren't that good. I'd get other sides.
My party had:
The jambalaya (not as salty as other reviews said).
The cheesesteak quesadilla

Drinks and service, however, were excellent ‚Äì very friendly and quick. Overall, a nice spot with great atmosphere, just a few small improvements on the food side would make it even better. (by Eduard) [2 weeks ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Visiting from out of town, California specifically, and stopped by here for dinner on a Thursday night. The service was great! Everyone was so nice and attentive. The live music was awesome! Comfortable chairs and tables. The food was so yummy! I got the ribs plate and my husband got the main chicken dish with the mustard based sauce. Everything was so amazing and I highly recommend! (by Ambrosia Solis) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - The crispy Brie was definitely delicious. We also had the seafood chowder and were in heaven with that dish.  The ladies had veggie soup and I heard no complaints.  Nice atmosphere and a very beautiful server. I would return to this establishment anytime. I‚Äôm from California and was impressed with everything (by Timo) [3 weeks ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - This pub is a fantastic spot for anyone who loves live music, great food, and a solid drink menu. The atmosphere is warm and lively, with talented local musicians playing most nights. The wings are top-notch ‚Äî crispy, saucy, and full of flavor. Their fish and chips are equally impressive, with perfectly battered fish and golden fries. There‚Äôs a great mix of local craft beers and popular picks on tap. The cocktails are surprisingly good too ‚Äî creative and well-made. Service is friendly and fast, even when it‚Äôs busy. It‚Äôs the kind of place where you can settle in for the night. Whether you're out with friends or just want a good pint and live tunes, this pub delivers. A true hidden gem worth revisiting. (by Tara Elizabeth) [3 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Lovely Irish pub with live music every evening. I really enjoyed the Irish music. The food was tasty, I got the Medieval Guinness Stew and my husband got fish and chips. We share the brownie with ice cream for dessert. Service is friendly and the food came out pretty quickly. The interior is wood and stone. (by Elizabeth Chiang) [2 months ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - It was a wonderful experience to have a few pints of kilkenny in Kilkenny I was glad it was at Matt the miller's bar, food delicious little bit expensive but well worth it, The staff were very friendly.

The service was very friendly. Took good care of us. Kids had fish and chips and I had ribs that were very moist and fall off the bone! Wife had pizza and it was good for her too (by Matthew Schoeffler) [5 months ago] | Review 8: 3 stars - Mediocre food, good service, great location and vibe. Their fish and chips was plain and soggy.

Definitely will be returning one day soon. (by Rob Stirling) [2 weeks ago] | Review 10: 5 stars - Just want to give a massive shout-out to Jennifer at Matt the Miller‚Äôs for being so incredibly sound. We‚Äôve been looking for somewhere to host a small, casual wedding party in Kilkenny and after traipsing around to many establishments that weren‚Äôt quite right, we finally found Jennifer at Matt's. She couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful or generous with her time and expertise. Jennifer showed us all the available options for what Matt‚Äôs could offer, made suggestions for how the day could run, talked us through menu options, and was just generally very informative without being pushy. She also then followed up with an email which outlined all that we‚Äôd discussed so that we had a reference for all the details. She‚Äôs been fantastic to respond to all questions via email, and I just couldn‚Äôt recommend her enough to anyone looking for a venue hire in Kilkenny. Matt‚Äôs is an altogether great pub, with good food, friendly service, and excellent live music. Highly recommend checking this place out, particularly on a Monday evening.

Food was gourgous and something for everyone. Can‚Äôt wait to go back. (by Nicky S) [a month ago] | Review 6: 3 stars - The restaurant has a beautiful view and the food is genuinely tasty, which makes it even more unfortunate that the experience was overshadowed by serious hygiene issues. The tables were not properly cleaned, the floor was dirty, and the restrooms were in an unsanitary state. On top of that, dogs were allowed inside the restaurant, which only added to the overall feeling of poor cleanliness.

It‚Äôs a shame, because with such a wonderful location and good food, this place could be amazing. I truly hope the management takes these concerns seriously and improves the hygiene standards, as it has great potential if these issues are addressed.

I had the salmon pasta and it was delicious. I definitely recommend this place and trust the team behind it.
The food arrived within 20‚Äì25 minutes, which was perfectly reasonable. (by arri mosaika) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - Place was very busy for a Tuesday night. Was great to see. The restaurant looked very classy and there was a great selection on the menu.
I had the Spaghetti Bolognaise and My partner had Meatballs with Spaghetti.
The Food was okay. The sauce wasn‚Äôt spectacular but was okay all the same. The past a was cooked nicely and was enjoyable.
The mince however in the spaghetti was grainy and mushy. I didn‚Äôt enjoy this and picked around it.
My partner enjoyed his food but would also agree that the tomato sauce could be better seasoned. The restaurant was lovely and clean and the staff were friendly. The table we were at was a little bit too close to other tables. Was very loud also in the restaurant so if you are looking for quieter dinner experience this is not the place at busy times but it was great atmosphere and was great to see the place busy.
Our dessert was great. I had tiramisu and my partner had panna cotta. Both yummy!
Would return but would definitely go for one of the pizzas as the looked incredible. (by Casey Maher) [3 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Delicious and fresh tasting food, even better than some of what we had in Italy. Nice presentation, and excellent desserts. (by Ben Taff) [2 weeks ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - The atmosphere is exceptional.  Very friendly staff, very clean,  open kitchen,  nothing to hide. Chefs are extremely professional,  every bit of the food you get is absolutely unbelievable. Pizza is made of Italian flour, real mozzarellacheese,  parmezan is genuine,   meat is tender and fresh. You can also get a draft Moretti bear.  Tiramisu is delicious,  ice cream is also top quality.
I advise to book a table as this place might be pretty packed in lunch time or evenings. If you are looking for top quality meal,  good Italian wine,  Italian pizza all at affordable but luxurious atmosphere that's your go.

We went around 1 in the afternoon and there was only one other group in the restaurant. The lady was very kind and helped understand the numbers on the menus were allergens. We ordered and the food came within 10 minute. My partner ordered the Irish breakfast and was in love. She said she ""10/10 recommends and everything was divine"". I did try the rashers and sausage and they were delicious. I ordered the omelette which was also delicious with pieces of ham, pepper, and onion in it and 2 pieces of bread. We shared an orange fanta as well. Definitely recommend if you are looking for a quick delicious breakfast spot.

Not too be dramatic but I have never had a better salad anywhere here in the US. Like I'm talking final meal-on my death bed, I need this salad. (by Delaney Hallahan) [5 months ago] | Review 5: 1 star - The breakfast was probably the poorest quality we've ever had, the eggs had to be sent back they looked like eggs that had sat in a deli all day, the young girl who served us was absolutely lovely and so polite.
Replying back:
Never asked for runny eggs and had no ideas on Eggs but they were cremated not well done, I do have a photo of all four plates.
yes eggs were changed when asked I never said otherwise, I thought your breakfast was very poor quality, I said they looked like they had sat in a deli all day not that they did or that you had a hot counter. my opinion in which as a paying customer I'm very much entitled to. Sorry if my opinion offended you in anyway but it was a very honest review. (by Lee) [3 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Such a lovely little caf√©!

I live locally and would love to be a frequent customer but this really turns me off.
My husband and I decided to give you another try this morning. When he asked could he have the bacon,on the breakfast stack unchopped,the waitress explained,that's the way it comes. She did suggest he could skip the bacon and replace it with an extra sausage only to discover, when our plates did arrive, that EVERYTHING was chopped. I am sorry,this just gives off the wrong vibe.
I would love to know why any cafe thinks this is a good idea?
You have a lovely space the food is disappointing. (by GRACE BILL) [3 months ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - I felt like I stepped into a  movie caf√©.

I thought it was a very sneaky add on. It would have been 3 separate tables when booking had this been pointed out... I don't see how this applies  when the same amount  of people are being served whether it be 1 or 3 tables.. we would have been leaving the same amount in a tip but not any more when dining there.. it nice to leave it of your own free will rather than being compelled to do so..  Just to be aware of this for a large family when booking your table... (by Gretta Murphy) [5 months ago] | Review 5: 1 star - Eaten here a couple of times and it‚Äôs been alright.

Pure dogs (by Jordan) [Edited a year ago] | Review 6: 1 star - Where to begin? A group of about 14 of us decided on this fine establishment for our annual get together. Disappointed is not the word. To begin, the staff were very pleasant but the services was okay at best. We were there for over 3 hours simply due to the slow pace of taking orders and poor structure to the complicated menu. After what I admit was a lot of food a few of us started to feel queasy. For me this feeling quickly turned into serious pain followed by some hardcore throwing up. I can‚Äôt say it was any one food in particular but if I had to guess it was the undercooked chicken or dodgy curry triangles. Personally, I‚Äôll never go back but this could have been a particularly poor night as I‚Äôve seen they have consistently good reviews. To conclude, no better than any take away. (by Shane Butler) [6 years ago] | Review 7: 1 star - I was very disappointed at going to ho ting tonight. Everytime I brought my family to ho thing the food and service was excellent, I went tonight and ordered food the restaurant was empty but service was slow. At the end of the meal I found out the menu I received before the meal was changed and new staff that were working got it wrong. They gave great service but the management said we got the wrong menus as they had to up the price due to changes in the economy and have no problem with that but should have been informed before ordering. my family were very disappointed but I believe when you read from a menu  everyone can order from different price range and not one table to order the same set meal deal.. everyone is a customer.. I have no problem  paying extra.. due to economy  change. But be bullied at the till. From a personal  opinion I think if management  was to change prices to up date  prices please update the menus and inform the staff. That's managements job. Not new staff.

At end of day
Ask before you order . The cost of dinner before you order..

Because they take advantage of you in front of your family and friends.

I believe  in small business around are community but that  take the piss.

Special if a child under 10 ordering  food . And its 1 starter 1 main for ‚Ç¨10 charging ‚Ç¨2.50 a dash of coke..

I would of highly  recommend  this company  in the last 2 years..

HO THING (by James Matthew Mcgrath) [6 years ago] | Review 8: 3 stars - Used to be my regular takeaway place, staff are really nice and so is the manager. Last time I ordered i was waiting an hour and twenty minutes, when the order arrived it was wrong and to top it off I found a peice of plastic in my food. Sadly wont be ordering again. 3 stars because as i say its usually great but I'd be weary.

We arrived home and the portion size was substantial, the chips were beautifully cooked but unfortunately the chicken was pink and we felt like we shouldn‚Äôt eat it . We rang the manager and she came to my house to look at the chicken, she gave us a full refund but we will never eat there again.

Rachel‚Äôs Garden Caf√© ‚Äì A Hidden Oasis in the Heart of Carlow

If you're anywhere near Leighlinbridge, do yourself a favour and stop into Rachel‚Äôs Garden Caf√© at the Arboretum ‚Äî it‚Äôs an absolute gem. The coffee is top-notch, the staff are warm, friendly, and genuinely a pleasure to deal with, and the whole atmosphere is just pure calm.

What really sets this place apart is the location. Surrounded by the beautifully maintained Arboretum gardens, you can sip your coffee while sitting in the sun, tucked into one of the many peaceful spots that make this place feel like a retreat from the world. It‚Äôs the perfect balance of a quality caf√© and a stunning garden experience.

An outstanding spot for a coffee, a stroll, and a bit of serenity. Highly recommended. (by Kildare Content Creator) [4 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Amazing oasis of calm and practicality in a lovely area just off the motorway.
Well worth a visit for all your gardening and homeware needs. Kitchenware, snazzy house things, gardening, BBQ and pets. Everything you need all served up in a bright, modern country style shopping experience.
Edinburgh knit wear shop with great value on clothing.
There is also a spacious food court with good quality food and drink. Coffee is very nice.
Outside there is a seating area in a sun room and also an inspirational garden.
For the kids there is a great playground and a genuine maze.
The toilets and spacious and clean with THE most amazing urinals I have ever seen. Ladies, stick your heads into the gents for a gawk!
Altogether a very fulfilling experience found by accident. Well done Mrs Doyle.

(by Alyson Burrell) [Edited 4 years ago] | Review 8: 3 stars - I ordered eggs Benedict here on the 3 july 25 it's a breakfast item that requires a little more skill to prepare and I have to say it was not good at all the whole item was smothered in Hollandaise sauce way too much, the eggs were way over cooked completely hard and the muffins were also hard. I ordered a cappuccino which had to be returned as it was luke warm but the replacement cup was lovely. I should have had the breakfast replaced but I didn't I was outside with my dog, so just inconvenient for me, the arboretum itself is lovely, breakfast though very disappointing. (by Jag Man) [2 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - This place is very local to the family we were visiting and so we stopped off here one day for lunch. The caf√© is spotlessly clean and has a varied menu including a number of daily specials. Add to this a great selection of craft cold drinks and wide range of hot beverages and there's pretty much everything you need.

Staff are friendly and polite and there are areas inside, in a conservatory and outside where you can eat. All in all this is a lovely spot for a meal whether standalone or as part of a bigger shopping trip to The Arboretum shopping village.

I kept wondering why they were not mentioning the cold and at least apologising for the heating, which must be broken, surely!? No, it was not broken they just held off until about 8.30pm to switch on heating. There was an older group of 4 with heavy coats on during their meal and they looked miserable. Just 10 minutes before they left the heating came on. Just outrageous. Took 45 mins to get basic starter, and an hour and half to get main our course. Place wasn't even half full. I got a vegetarian starter which I'm pretty sure had a fish sauce in it. Main meal was cold. I'm just sorry I didn't leave when I got there.

Love the place and the staff were so good üòä (by DZ Avel) [3 months ago] | Review 6: 1 star - Even after the standard in Nori has dropped/changed chef, their food quality is still higher than Moon Asian restaurant. It really depends on, whether Kilkenny people accepts this kind of standard.

1a. I lost appetite after putting the soggy rice into my mouth. It is half porridge/congee form. No idea what sauce they have added as topping (mixture of 2 or 3 gloopy sauces). Crispy Chicken rice (Chicken Cutlet rice), I was expecting Oyako Don, hoping to have sweet onions and sweet soya sauce and egg on the rice with chicken cutlet.
1b. I saw Curry rice with Cutlet pork chop or chicken in the menu (a photo). The staff started reading out all the names under the rice menu to ask me to pick from them. I can do a way better job than them! Please remove any images that the 'restaurant' does not serve!
2. A-ge Tofu. The type of tofu the've used is right. But, the coating is not glutinous rice flour, which is supposed to give it a slurpy gooey texture.
3. The sushi-s. Disappointment for the price. Rice is japanese rice, but no sushi rice vinegar on them. California roll's low quality (doesn't pop like caviar/boba tea) 'fake' fish eggs weren't even covering the outer layer of the sushi. There is no sweet egg omelette in it too, only avocado and crab sticks, no cucumber. Don't know if there is any Kewpie Japanese mayo in it.
3. Vegetarian roll. No sushi vinegar. No mayo. Only flavour I can taste is the seaweed salad's sauce (which originally came from a bag). At least they made the effort to use marinated white radish (most likely store bought) and marinated fried tofu skin (from a packet, since it is hard to make them).

Is it worth the ‚Ç¨40 euro price? I rather visit the Wexford restaurant and give them feedback to pick back up the standards, at least they did not air-tight the hot crispy a-ge tofu (my husband complains). (by Leung Hiu Ching Oriana) [a year ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - We headed to this restaurant with friends.

The Merry Tree - Rathwood,Carlow,"Rath, Carlow, R93 CX74, Ireland",Restaurant,3.9,,+353 59 915 6285,"Review 1: 2 stars - I would not recommend this restaurant to any coeliac due to the limited options, even if the web page and other reviews claim more options that is not the case. The cross contamination is on another level and the only redeeming quality about this restaurant is that you can go on a walk in Rathwood.

I ordered a salad, as this was the only coeliac friendly option with no worry about cross contamination. However, I was disappointed to find that the strawberries in my salad were old and mouldy. When I raised this complaint to staff, I was given a new salad with no mouldy strawberries, however, nothing further was done about the issue and there was no apology.  The food was just not fresh so nevermind even the cross contamination issues but the food being old is bad enough.

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone at all. (by Dorota Dabek) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Had a lovely meal here with family.

Have ordered many times before and boy has the quality dipped. Ordered the Crazy Jalfrezi. The marketing photos look good but mine looked like someone dumped BBQ sauce all over it. Drizzle‚Ä¶couldn‚Äôt be further from a drizzle. The fajita fiesta was marginally better. Again a bit heavy handed with the sauce. (by Mary Redmond) [Edited a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - When I first turned to Apache Carlow, I was looking for something different, something that could help me build the unique family I always dreamed of. Little did I know, this would lead to a whirlwind adventure of both fatherhood and love‚Äî50 times over!

Apache Carlow was nothing short of a miracle. Through their innovative approach to... well, life in general, I was blessed with the ability to bring 50 wonderful children into this world. Each birth was handled with the utmost care and precision, making sure both my kids and their mothers were in safe hands. I still remember the joy of watching each new addition to my family and knowing that Apache Carlow played an instrumental role in making it all happen.

But that's not all‚ÄîApache Carlow had some unexpected bonuses along the way. As I worked my way through their life-altering services, I found myself meeting incredible women who shared my vision for a big, happy family. Through fate (and maybe a little help from the universe), I met 50 amazing women who I‚Äôm lucky enough to call my wives today.

There was something magical about how everything came together‚ÄîApache Carlow didn't just help me start a family; it helped me build a community, a support network, and a truly one-of-a-kind household. The sense of unity, love, and teamwork that we all share is something that I never could have achieved on my own.

If you're looking for a way to multiply your family in the most surprising and life-affirming way, look no further than Apache Carlow. It‚Äôs not just a service‚Äîit‚Äôs a life-changing journey that led me to my 50 beautiful children and 50 incredible wives. I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful!

Comfy waiting sitting room with blazing warm fire  welcoming you in on a chilly night. Lots of little details that add up to careful thought and hard work preparation!

Craft beer, normal beers and wines.

Warm bread rolls, fresh out of the oven.

Scallops in a lobster bisque sauce. Wonderful rich flavour in every mouthful.

Beef cheek, slow cooked, parsnip, celeriac and again an amazing sauce.

Pork belly, melt in the mouth with an explosion of flavour. Toulouse sausage and black pudding.

Perfectly cooked John dory. Light fluffy crispy skin. Amazing.

Fillet steak, mash. Nothing more nothing less. A small pot of pure heaven in the form of a reduced sauce. Magic.

All served with cheese gratin potatoes, and a sort of ratatouille,  courgette and tomatoes.

Magnificent meal.

Deserts. Again perfect.

Rhubarb fool. Shortbread biscuits. Fool light fluffy full of flavour. Ruburb compote underneath. Served in a double walled glass floating in mid air! Excellent shortbread.

Banana custard with crunchy fingers and ice cream. Fizzy melt in your pop. Pops with flavour.

Cheese board. Excellent.

Baileys coffee, cappuccino,  latte and espresso.

It is rare to find a place to eat where everything works seamlessly.

Friendly professional staff, superb food, happy guests and every course perfect. Easy to find 1 good course or another but EVERY course requires dedication from a team who should be proud of their work and results.

I get a dreamy flat white and one of the many delicious pastries, I‚Äôve really liked their cruffins this summer but there‚Äôs a special place in my heart (belly) for their hazelnut pan au chocolate. My partner gets a filter coffee from the lovely Clayton and a fruit scone. The filter is incredible and beautifully presented. It‚Äôs lovely sitting outside and watching the pour through the hatch and then  delivered by the man himself who is always up for a bit of a chat. We never leave without a bag of Farmhouse coffee and a sourdough. We have tried their soups in the winter as well as a very tasty French toast with cherry and meringue! I cannot fault this place. Every member of staff go above and beyond even when the place is jammers! It‚Äôs the best. (by Amy Kenealy) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Waterlilies is a lovely place to grab a quick coffee.

The pasta dish and the steak were both enjoyed by our party. Italian-born staff involved and servers are very attentive. (by Jo Gar) [2 months ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Given that this is a Michael-starred restaurant with so many awards, I expected better service. When we finished our meal, we had to order dessert just to have the plates cleared. Despite using our napkins and finishing our meal, the dirty napkins were not taken away by the waitstaff. My empty soda glass remained on the table until the bill arrived, and no waiter picked it up. For a place with such a prestigious reputation, I expected a higher level of service.

As for the food, it was good but not exceptional. The desserts, however, were fantastic and truly wowed us. The ambiance of the place was very nice, but it was a bit stuffy and warm inside. Improving the ventilation would be beneficial.

Restrooms are one of the most important aspects of a restaurant, and here they were very clean, just as I expected, with a fresh scent. (by Mr. Sam) [a year ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Phenomenal service & food with great value. Take all the recommendations they offer.

There‚Äôs a reason this is a Top 10 restaurant in Ireland. Don‚Äôt miss it. (by Amy Brauner) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 2 stars - If you‚Äôre visiting from the United States, particularly if you‚Äôre accustomed to the culinary standards of cities like Miami or New York, the food here may come across as underwhelming. The dishes lack depth and complexity of flavor, leaning toward the bland and uninspired. I would recommend avoiding the steaks or any beef cuts, which were particularly disappointing.

Service also fell short of expectations ‚Äî we were left with soiled plates on our table for an extended period, and water refills had to be repeatedly requested. Overall, the experience did not meet the level of hospitality or quality one might hope for when dining out. (by Phillip Rybin) [2 months ago] | Review 10: 4 stars - Overall, we had a lovely experience here. The food is good. I get the feeling the staff/owners think it's ""high end"" - it's not.

(by Saoirse Foley) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 1 star - My partner and I recently visited Brooks Carlow, and unfortunately, our experience was far from what we expected. From the moment we arrived, we felt uncomfortable due to the behavior and comments from the staff. At one point during our visit, the staff member responded to my partner giving his order first by saying, ""Ladies first, did you ever hear of it?"" This comment was not only unnecessary but also incredibly embarrassing. He felt singled out in an uncomfortable way, as if we were being chastised for something as trivial as the order of who spoke first. It was a completely inappropriate remark that added to the overall unwelcoming atmosphere. The service was not only unwelcoming but also dismissive, which completely overshadowed our visit.

Mimosa Bar de Tapas,Carlow,"College St, Carlow, Ireland",Tapas restaurant,4.7,,,"Review 1: 3 stars - A truly lovely place,the lighting is soft and cozy, creating a warm and snug atmosphere. The food is nice, portions are good, and the prices are reasonable.

However, the service was very very slow, and some of the staff came across as a bit off-putting. I waited 20 minutes after receiving my food before asking a server about my partner‚Äôs food,he said he‚Äôd check and come back, but never did. We had to ask someone else in the end.

Overall, the food and setting were great, but the service definitely needs improvement.

Mimosa is hands down one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm, welcoming, and beautifully designed. The staff was incredibly friendly and attentive without being overbearing.

The food? Absolutely phenomenal. Every dish we ordered was flavorful, fresh, and presented with care. You can tell there's a lot of thought put into the menu.

Drinks were also on point, and the dessert selection was the perfect way to finish off the meal.

Highly recommend Mimosa for anyone looking for a memorable meal, whether it's a special occasion or just a night out. We will definitely be back!

We felt so comfortable from early on and knew we were in good hands. The revamp to the Powder Room is also fab. Both hair and makeup commented how great it was and the lighting was perfect as other venues don‚Äôt seem to cater for that. It really was brilliant and would highly recommend. We love our food and we couldn‚Äôt fault it - the attention that the Chef puts into the food is just next-to-none. You also have exclusive use of the venue so there‚Äôs no concerns at all!

Our dinner was amazing, as was the service, and everyone loved the dessert options as well. We went to the hotel‚Äôs bar for drinks afterwards and had an absolutely perfect experience. (by Sandra Hornak) [4 months ago] | Review 2: 1 star - The atmosphere is nice, and the service was good with friendly staff. However, the food was absolutely shocking. We had the loaded potatoes, which were basically potato chips with a can of tomato sauce on top. We had the caesar salad which should not be called a salad, as we had basically no lettuce, 5000 pounds of dressing, and what looked like an entire chicken shredded on top. Very disappointing. The prawn tacos, the prawns themselves were good, the taco shell tasted stale, and the mango sauce on top tasted like hand soap. So a hand soap taco, with prawns. I was hungry when I left, and 60 euros more poor. Will never be back. (by Kyra Todd) [6 days ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Stopped by ,spur of the moment, on our way to Cork. They seated us right away. Very clean and the food was great. Strawberry cream cocktail and a smithwicks red ale. Very good. Light music playing in the background, was a excellent touch. They validate your parking on a certain street. I ordered a steak sandwich and I was surprised I loved all the toppings. He ordered shrimp salad and enjoyed the as well. Hostess was super nice and paid attention when she needed to. (by Bee) [a year ago] | Review 4: 4 stars - Overall a good experience. Food was tasty but the chips (fries) were right out of a frozen bag. For the cost and scale of this place hand cut chips would have been more appealing also they were cold to make matters worse. Staff were excellent, super nice and polite. Seats and table were lovely and comfortable. I would go back again and would recommend the steak. (by Gerard Newsham) [5 months ago] | Review 5: 2 stars - I guess it would be grand if you are with a man.  In 20 minutes my sister and I were ignored twice while tables with a man were waited on. Only four tables in total and one was done so to have such rude disregard from the waiter was so unacceptable we left.  Excellent service and food just a few steps down the street at the Hibernian bar with excellent door and Service    Beautiful bar area (by Cynthia Marsh) [2 weeks ago] | Review 6: 4 stars - Breakfast tasted nice but we wish someone offered water, juice, toast, etc. since it's not a buffet, just a menu card with beverages explaining what's available would be nice. Felt bad chasing down the server three times.  Very friendly but not entirely attentive. (by Jake Slutzky) [a year ago] | Review 7: 2 stars - I ordered a Sirloin steak with pepper sauce and I think the Chef ought to have his licence to use salt revoked.

The sauce made what was otherwise a nice well cooked piece of beef almost inedible for me.

My wife had a sticky pudding with caramel that was also overdosed with salt.

Some chefs mistake salt for flavour and I'm not a fan at all. (by Paul Connolly) [3 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - This was by far the best meal I have eaten in a very long time !

Good service from the staff and dog friendly outside area! (by Judy Burne) [3 months ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Sadly no idea what food was like - we didn't get any.  Likewise, the only thing I can say about the service was that we didn't get any.

We entered the dining room to be greeted with a grunt to pick our own table.  Having done so, we sat for 10 minutes during which nobody acknowledged us. Not even a glance in our direction.  We left shortly afterwards.  Nobody noticed is leaving.

The approach to service seemed to be, ""ignore them and maybe they'll go away"".  Well, job done.

Don't waste your time.  There are better options in Kilkenny.

Despite the limited menu I still struggled to decide what dishes I wanted - I wanted them all! We had 3 courses each and every single plate was perfection.

(by Drew Heron) [7 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - It was good food, I liked the rice a lot personally and the naan bread, tho I would have liked more salt on both. I am not a big fan of the cashew/peanut taste and therefore it gets a 4 and not a 5. The chips we got were very good and the best part, in my opinion. Good portions, tho a bit much sauce. The food was done in 15 min or less and they gave us a plastic bag over the paper one because it was raining, really appreciate that one. The man at the desk was nice and made sure we got what we wanted. I understand why people like it even tho it's not completely my style. (I had butter chicken, looking past the nuts it had good taste, the flavour of nuts was just a bit too overpowering for me.) We had food for two for around 28 euro, which is a good price.

All in all good food, pretty cheap, nice people and fast service. (by Kari Sandburg) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 1 star - Very disappointed, order quite regularly and have had no issues. This time used their website/app and paid by card. After about 10 mins I contacted the restaurant to advise that my order wasn't confirmed but I was charged and the person on the phone advised they would look into it and contact me back. I received no call/update and after a hour I still had no food. I tried numourous times to call them and eventually got through only to be told that they aren't accepting online orders today (surely this was known the first time I called but even still the website ordeing service should be temporarily shut down in cases like this). The staff member was incredibly unsympathetic and rude. I'm out of pocket now, never received any food and have to wait to see if the payment was processed on their side and follow up with them before I can get any refund, needless to say I won't order from them again.

Great service (by Romulo Romulando) [a year ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Very disappointed in the service and food we received today. Upon arrival the person who greeted us was very Stand offish, not very helpful and quite rude. We were told it was unlimited naan bread and chips with the buffet price we were paying, which was not the case. They never asked us if we were okay for everything when we could see they were asking other customers if they needed anything else, which we then found out they were regular customers, which would not make new clientele return as it was as if our custom was not good enough, other people given a jug of water on arrival, we never received any despite asking twice for it, the selection of food on the buffet was nothing short of laughable. The food itself was below average, no flavour whatsoever . We were also quiet nervous about going for extra food as there was signs all around the buffet insinuating that if there is food left on our plate that we would be charged extra for, also on their website they advertise the buffet at ‚Ç¨15 a head per adult, when we went in it was more expensive then initially advertised as, would not recommend, will not be returning. Rang to express our dissatisfaction and the worker was the rudest man I have ever spoken to in a customer service job, he hung up the phone twice, unless you are looking to have a an upset stomach, are willing to stay close to a toilet seat all evening and leaving with an empty wallet stay away at all costs.

If you‚Äôve ever wondered what it‚Äôs like to pay good money for a plate of regret, look no further.

As someone who‚Äôs dairy intolerant, I came prepared to make a simple request: vegan cheese. The waitress, clearly thrilled to be there, reluctantly checked with a colleague before returning with the shocking revelation that they didn‚Äôt have any. Fine. I then asked whether the mozzarella was from buffalo or cow‚Äôs milk ‚Äî a question apparently so outrageous it was met with an abrupt ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù  So, I ordered the pizza without cheese, bracing myself for something plain but edible. What arrived was‚Ä¶ art. Not the good kind ‚Äî more like a modern installation titled ""Why Did I Bother?""
The mushrooms? Bland, rubbery slithers that could easily be mistaken for strips of boiled fat.
Save yourself the trouble ‚Äî and your stomach ‚Äî and eat literally anywhere else.

I have mixed feelings about this review as I‚Äôd be rating two menu items that I have recently tried here.

First, their mixed grill kebab with Naan bread ( lamb doner meat + grilled chicken tikka) is amazing. Fresh, right balance of flavor and spices and very generous portion. The dips are amazing and adds a great punch to the flavor. I also love their naan bread which is always fresh and crisp.

On the other hand I tried their Chicken Supreme Pizza on multiple occasions and it made me hate Pizzas for the very first time. The dough is ok-ish, a very low quality cheese, Chicken cubes were not even boiled properly. The pizza had a distinct smell and an uncooked flavor profile.
Also, I believe Pizzas are over priced. (by Omer Ali) [Edited 2 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Never disappointed. 16"". Generous toppings, taste full of flavour.

There was 8 of us and our order was taken by a very nice chap who got the order bang on.
When the food was dropped down we were short two forks for our bacon and cheese fries..
I asked female waitress for two more ‚Ä¶we waited for 10min after getting our food  .. still no forks
Went up to the counter to the same girl who was initially asked, and asked her again for two forks to be told they were out of cutlery and that they were waiting on the dish washer to finish ‚Ä¶.( Note the restaurant was half full ‚Ä¶. and no forks)

5 mins later after our two teenagers tried to eat the food with their fingers the same girl came down and slammed two forks on the table and said ‚Äúthere you go I can‚Äôt make the dish washer machine  wash them any quicker‚Äù and walked away ..
Shocked at what was said to me I got up  ‚Ä¶ went back over to her at the counter and said ‚Äú excuse me, you can have them back(handing her back the forks) and next time,  don‚Äôt be so rude‚Äù
I then returned to our table and continued with our food.
Within 3 minutes a female manager approached our table ‚Ä¶ not to apologise or ask what happened .. but to tell me that I made a child cry and I should ashamed of myself‚Ä¶. (Staff member was 18-20 Y)

The manager went on to try and make our party feel bad  by saying I was aggressive and should be ashamed.
She continue to explain that she would not allow anyone upset her staff and she would back them.

We tried to explain to her what had happened but continued to embarrass herself as a so called manager by telling me I should be ashamed of myself again and again. I asked if she was finished .. and to leave us eat our food ..

The manager returned again for a second time 5 min later to continue where she left off and still continued to try and defend the actions of her staff member ‚Ä¶

I told her that if she felt her staffs actions were correct then her management skills needed to be looked at.
Maybe next time the staff member should hand wash a few forks instead of making customers wait ‚Ä¶.

Eddie Rockets clearly need to look at what way they train their managers .. while sticking up for your staff is admiral ‚Ä¶ you need to find out both sides of the story before telling a customer they should be ashamed of themselves ‚Ä¶ crazy outcome to an over priced take away.

He gave us our seats with no hassle but when we were ordering, as we didn‚Äôt understand the menu we asked about the ‚Äúcombo‚Äù. The lady said ‚Äúwe have soft drinks‚Äù but since my girlfriend didn‚Äôt hear her correctly she said ‚Äúhow do you people say it, soda?‚Äù (it says soda on the menu by the way).
Off the bat this lady has been giving dirty looks pointing at us to colleagues. A waiter then came with her and asked us for our order; when my girlfriend‚Äôs friend turn came, she asked for a smash burger and asked if there was pork in it. The lady said no, but the meat was not halal. She then said that her chefs, as muslims, they only eat chicken.
The woman kept arguing about it as if she was Muslim, she refused to give us food and asked for all of us to leave. The waiter was visibly shocked too.

I wish I was over exaggerating but I‚Äôm not, honestly the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had in any restaurant in my 18 years of living, all because of a white lady with dark, a red shirt and a wrinkly face.

Me, my boyfriend and my friend went in, a waiter gave us the menu and since me and my friend never went there, we asked a woman either dark hair and a red shirt who was working there to explain the menu for us. After that, her and a waiter came by to take our orders and since my friend is muslim, I asked if there was pork in the beef. She said ‚Äúno, but our beef is not halal‚Äù.
My friend, who‚Äôs a fellow believer of her religion, wanted to order the meal anyway due to the absence of pork in the meat, but the woman did not allow her, justifying herself by saying that her cookers are muslim and that they only eat chicken. She didn‚Äôt even consult them, so how can a non-muslim woman be so sure of something she‚Äôs not part of?
This is not the first time that my friend went to a fast food restaurant, so she definitely knows what she‚Äôs doing.
The woman did not want her to allow her to order the meal she wanted and she ended up kicking us out and accusing my friend to be a nonbeliever, after removing the menu from our hands and accusing my friend of being rude, ignorant and mean.

Me and my friend are from Italy and we just wanted to have a nice time before leaving. We‚Äôve traveled around the world and this has never happened to us.

I ordered the egg Benedict with hollandaise sauce , but it wasn't hollandaise ( tasted like watered down taco sauce )and it was one slice of bread that was soggy as eggs weren't drained off.

My wife got smashed avocado, but it wasn't smashed it was sliced avocado with salad and soggy bread as the eggs weren't drained . The smashed avocado was terrible, this needs to be looked at . Both eggs were hard boiled and they need to update the menu as the food served doesn't match the description on menu  especially the hollandaise sauce served needs to be changed from hollandaise to taco sauce and smashed avocado needs to be changed to sliced avocado salad

Zuni Restaurant,Carlow,"26 Patrick St, Gardens, Kilkenny, R95 A897, Ireland",Modern European restaurant,4.7,,+353 56 772 3999,"Review 1: 3 stars - We were really looking to our dinner at Zuni. The atmosphere was very nice even though it was not full.

Sadly the food was not great. The trout appetizer was good. The cod was overwhelmed by the edamame and mushy peas. The biggest letdown was the steak. I asked for medium rare they came back rare so I had them taken back to the kitchen to cook a little bit longer when I came back if it was still rare, but I did not want to bother them again to reheat it to the right temperature because my mashed potatoes were getting cold.  Honestly, they should‚Äôve taken the potatoes back when I sent the steak. Also when the waiter came back, he should‚Äôve checked in to see if the steak was properly cooked. He didn‚Äôt wait until the very end when there were several large pieces on the plate that were unedible. When he finally asked us how it was we told him that the steak was not properly cooked. He just said he was sorry.

A meat thermometer could have properly solved the problem. Also when a customer has an unsatisfactory meal it could either be taken off the bill or be offered a complimentary dessert. (by Virginia Huffman) [a week ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - We were very satisfied with the dinner experience here. Food was impeccable, we loved the slow cooked beef, pork belly and especially enjoyed the appetizer rabbit terrine with lentils. The desert was interesting and the presentation was fun to watch, watching the hot caramel sauce poured over chocolate covered banana ice cream ball on a chocolate sponge cake.
The waitress was very sweet and attentive. (by Yongmei Zhang) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Locals and forums recommended this restaurant. I am so happy we listened.
The presentation of the dishes, the hospitality, it was all stellar. Jess was warm, welcoming, and very attentive. (by emily biddulph) [a month ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Out of this world Pork Belly. Extremely inventive and solid Roared Cauliflower dish. (by Phong Luu) [5 days ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Make a reservation, you won't regret it.

I ordered pork belly as a starter. I was extremely hesitant about the banana chutney, but with the glazed pork belly it was well balanced and delicious. It works. Also the pork belly melted, it was so tender.

The strip loin was cooked exactly how I wanted it. Medium rare. The onion hash brown had a great crisp on the outside and complimented every bite with the steak. I treated the croquette as a little bonus with the carrot puree. The edge of the strip loin (3 bites) was a little more medium and dryer, but you wouldn't notice it with a little sweep of the bone marrow jus.

I'd be remiss to not mention the Strawberry Smash cocktail. I thought it was very nice and smooth. I had ordered an old fashion afterwards and even that was executed correctly with the orange rub along the rim.

I think for a starter, main, and two cocktails it was priced pretty reasonable for this level of quality.

I only had one night here, but I would return on a future visit.

The service was very attentive and they made multiple touch points throughout the dinner. (by Eric) [11 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - We went to this restaurant that a friend suggested and it quickly became our favorite!

(by Kwang Sujinno) [a year ago] | Review 7: 2 stars - Wonderful atmosphere and the bathroom was lovely. I got a cappuccino and it made me feel sick after a few sips. My boyfriend had an Americano and felt ill after too. The lemon meringue alaska was nice but the banoffee ball was too sweet, the hot caramel was too much. I think the customer should be allowed to pour it themselves to control how much sauce is added. (by Heather McA) [5 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Had lunch here and was so impressed.

Presented well. Filled with blueberries, strawberry, crushed walnut. I did order without the mascarpone (soft Italian cream cheese).

Yogurt & Granola:

*Table water is infused with whole mint leaves

Honestly I finally found a place which is 5* for everything.

Service : friendly & quick
Food: seen that salad on the picture? That's the most fantastic , bombastic thing Ive had in Ireland ever since I moved . All the ingredients worked so good with each other, the way it was served, the amount of food on the plate. Best 14 euros I spent. I don't mind travelling to Kilkenny once in a while just for that salad.
The cheese cake is also amazing. Reminded me of home. And the way they serve latte is just so cute
Atmosphere: just as I like. Small caffe for up to 10 tables maybe. Very cozy.  What I like about such places is that you can feel that people care and put effort in what they are doing.

So whoever is in Kilkenny and wants sometimes nice - go there.

Price very reasonable regarding the actual challenging situation in Hospitality business.

Chilli Lounge,Cavan,"CHILLI LOUNGE, 32 Main St, Townparks, Cavan, H12 E7D4, Ireland",Modern Indian restaurant,4.7,,+353 49 438 0693,"Review 1: 5 stars - Super friendly staff, vegan friendly food without compromising authenticity or quality.   Fantastic price point, we called in that day to book a table and staff were very accommodating considering the busy valentines weekend.

After a disastrous and disappointing Valentines dinner at lakeside manor, the food we were served here pales in comparison. Absolutely stunning food! We ordered everything to be vegan/vegetarian and they did not disappoint. No hidden shortcuts, food was cooked from fresh and separate from meat cooked dishes (very important as if it was cooked in the same pots and pans of meat cooked dishes, the flavour of meat would have poured into the food). We were even offered a complimentary dish which was absolutely delicious and very much appreciated. Hats off to the chef and waiters. We will definitely return again and will recommend to all.

Only downside was, we didn‚Äôt have enough space for all the food and felt a bit cramped, but the food speaks for itself so, this minor negative vanishes into the background because before we knew it, all the food was gone and we were very happy. We will definitely return!

3 sides, 2 mains +1 complimentary. Fantastic service, wait time was excellent and the same goes for the price. (by Arvin Coloma) [6 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - I had an amazing experience dining at this Indian restaurant. I made a reservation on the same day and was promptly seated upon arrival. The menu was extensive with options ranging from hot to mild to creamy dishes. I decided to try the chilli masala and it was hands down the best I have ever had in the last 10 years.

The service was impeccable, with the staff always wearing a smile and ready to assist with any requests. The food was outstanding in both taste and presentation. The customer service was top-notch and the atmosphere of the restaurant was inviting and pleasant. Additionally, the restaurant was very clean which added to the overall positive experience.

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious Indian cuisine served with exceptional customer service. I will definitely be returning in the future. (by Mark Smith) [a year ago] | Review 3: 4 stars - Hi there,
I wanted to share my experience from my recent visit to Chilli Lounge Restaurant. This was my second time visiting the restaurant and unfortunately, the food this time was really not up to par compared to my first visit. There was a mix-up with my order and the plain Naan bread I received was not cooked well. However, after bringing this to the attention of the staff, they promptly replaced it with a perfectly cooked Naan bread.

I must say, I was impressed by the way the staff handled the situation and their excellent customer service. The ambiance of the restaurant was extraordinary and I particularly enjoyed the complementary dishes that were served.

What really stood out for me was the small surprise they gave us for our engagement anniversary - a cake and a song. It was truly heart touching and made our evening even more special.
Overall, while there were some hiccups with the food, the exceptional service and thoughtful gestures from the staff definitely made up for it. (by Jonisha Joe) [a year ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - Don‚Äôt be shied away by the entryway. Inside is an exquisite array of dishes to satisfy your culinary curiosity.

Chilli Lounge is at the top of my list for Indian food! We ate there Sunday for the second time and my meal was just as fantastic as the first visit. The service issue the first day must‚Äôve been a fluke because Sunday they were on top of everything.

I ordered LAMB BALTI and it was perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth, buttery smooth and oh so flavorful! Their Naan with garlic and cilantro is well seasoned. They don‚Äôt skimp on the real garlic.

Finishing the meal with sorbet is a delightful treat. Smooth, crisp, tropical with a hint of citrus. It freshens the palate and sends you off feeling refreshed and sated but not overly full.

I can‚Äôt recommend Cilli Lounge enough.
I‚Äôll be back the next time I‚Äôm in Ireland! (by Dawn Chadbourne) [11 months ago] | Review 5: 1 star - We called a day before our visit from Dublin to confirm that we wanted the smoky dry ice effect for a birthday celebration, as seen on your Instagram. You assured us it would be done, and we requested a cake to record for the occasion, to which you agreed.

We traveled 2.5 hours to your restaurant. Upon arrival, we were told the smoky effect wasn't available due to a delivery issue. Despite our prior confirmation, you claimed it was a miscommunication.

We ordered 1 starter, a bottle of wine, 3 curries, and 3 naan breads,  got a complimentary slice of cake to celebrate the birthday. Out of the three curries, one was incorrect, so we asked you to replace it.

Your edited response to our review incorrectly blamed us for improper ordering. The food was extremely oily and not authentic Indian, as I know from being from Delhi and dining at many places in Ireland. While we were eating, you asked how the food was, and we told you it was oily. You replied, ""I am sorry, it‚Äôs busy, maybe that‚Äôs why,"" and offered us alcohol on the house to compensate, which we declined since we already had our bottle of wine.

We paid 66 euros in your restaurant, so don‚Äôt lie by saying we ordered only 1 or 2 things. Thank God we have proof to show, otherwise your fake comment could turn the tables and make it look like we lied.

We didn‚Äôt enjoy our dinner but didn‚Äôt want to be rude because we were there to celebrate, not to fight. As customers, it‚Äôs our right to leave an honest review, so stop messaging us asking to remove it. We didn‚Äôt say anything to your face because you apologized, but it didn‚Äôt make up for the ruined birthday night.

You gave us a complimentary starter due to the unavailability of the dry ice effect, but it didn‚Äôt improve the experience.

The service was poor, and your response to our review was dishonest. We appreciated the gesture, but the overall service and food quality were disappointing. Stop editing your comments to shift the blame onto customers.

We are replying to your fake and wrong comment which you edited two days later, thinking we wouldn‚Äôt notice. Be honest about your mistakes and improve your food quality and service.

Attaching the pics of what we exactly ordered so that people know how smartly you lied.

We don‚Äôt want to keep posting bad reviews, so kindly appreciate customer feedback and be apologetic for your mistakes. Thanks. We won‚Äôt be ever visiting again. Bye. (by Rahul Arya) [Edited a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - We had a wonderful dinner date at chilli lounge! The ambiance was lovely and the service was top notch. Our server was so attentive and kind.

(by FH) [a month ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - We had an incredible night at Chilli Lounge with our party of 4! The ambiance was fantastic, setting the tone for a wonderful evening. The food was absolutely delicious - the biryani was flavorful and mouth-watering, and the naan was incredibly soft. But what truly made our experience stand out was the amazing service. The team at Chilli Lounge were so kind, caring, and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed throughout the night.

If you're looking for authentic and delicious Indian food in Cavan, look no further than Chilli Lounge. We had a fantastic time and can't wait to come back!

St. Kyran's Restaurant,Cavan,"Dublin road, Virginia, Co. Cavan, Ireland",,4.5,,+353 49 854 7087,"Review 1: None - We had our wedding reception in St Kyrans on June 29th 2024. We cannot express how over the moon we were with the service provided. Firstly the venue is absolutely beautiful. We live locally and were so happy to celebrate our wedding with amazing views of lough ramor as the backdrop.

We contacted Helena and Patrick about our wedding plans in May 2023 after getting engaged and from that moment onwards they could not have been more helpful. We had a BBQ style meal outside on the terrace and the sun shone down on all the guests as we took in the amazing views while we ate. We were absolutely blown away by the food and desserts served. As two foodies seeing everyone so satisfied with their meals was certainly one of the highlights of our night.  I cannot keep track of how many guests contacted me afterwards to compliment the quality of the food. It was absolutely outstanding and on a whole other level to other wedding venues in our opinion. The venue did an amazing job of catering for all of our guests with dietary requirements and made sure guests were never left without a topped up drink in their hand.

In the run up to the wedding Helena and Patrick helped us feel at ease by reassuring us that they had thought of every little detail. This meant we could relax on the day knowing our guests were taken care of. Some of our guests had cancelled flights the night before the wedding and arrived much later than planned. Helena went above and beyond for these guests stay up late to check them all in.

We highly recommend St Kyrans as a wedding or party venue. Helena and Patrick are clearly passionate about what they do and provide an exceptional service with a warm personal touch.

Fresh and vibrant and a good variety of choices.

Service very average in fact poor. Left waiting 20mins after finishing main course so gave up on the idea of coffee and desserts. Table was sticky to the touch so not cleaned properly and we watched a young waitress simply wipe a cleared table's debris straight on to the floor.
Waiting staff simply need training.

The atmosphere was warm and inviting, the music was entertaining and I felt as if I could have a conversation without feeling like I had to shout to be heard. The staff are so friendly and welcoming will definitely be back again just on this alone. For food my partner had the 8oz steak burger, staff ask you allow 15 minutes of a wait for the burger to be made fresh and safe to say it was worth the wait. The burger was cooked to perfection, it was juicy and tender. I had the homemade lasagna and boy was it delicious with real Irish beef mince and homemade coleslaw. 10/10 highly recommend for anyone to go here if given the chance to.

Yum Yum Fast Food & Take Away,Cavan,"Main St, Doon, Ballyconnell, Co. Cavan, Ireland",Indian takeaway,3.5,,+353 49 952 7829,"Review 1: 1 star - I would say this is probably the worst experience of fast food I have ever had.
I ordered 2 philly cheese steak subs and a child's hamburger meal. The kids meals advertised were not available.
I was told they ""only do nugget meals"".
While waiting for our food to be prepared I witnessed the lady preparing pizza dough portions sneeze into her hand and continue to work without washing her hands.
The subs were chopped burgers on a wrap dripping in grease.
Upon complaining we were completely dismissed.
Safe to say I will never return! (by Kellyanne Mary Moore) [a month ago] | Review 2: 1 star - Absolutely shocking, ordered a chicken sub and I'm given a chicken wrap with one piece of chicken and a load of veg to cover it up, on top of that they are advertising chicken wings online but instead you get some crappy rubbery chicken goujons instead. Not once did they ring me or tell me that none of the items I ordered were unavailable but going to be something else. I rang them asking what was the story and was given crappy excuses and no apology. Absolutely shocking service, shocking food and I will never order from here ever again (by Sofia O'Neill) [11 months ago] | Review 3: 1 star - I had a really bad experience with Yum Yum Takeaway.

Reserved a table for around 3 pm, wasn't full so maybe not necessary but by the time we left it was absolutely full. We all had starters, main courses and desserts and everybody was happy with their meal. We had a member of our party that couldnt make the stairs and they have a lift which was great (we were on the 2nd floor). We had a vegatarian with us and they were well catered for although there wasnt a huge selection for them to pick from. the lamb shank was partciularly scrumptious, falling off the bone and so tender. The desserts were good, with the gingerbread cheesecake a lovely way to end the meal, see the little gingerbread men in the attached pictures.

Service was quick even though they were obviously a bit rushed due to the place being completely full. For anyone in town I would definitely recommend it. (by George Mavroudis) [6 months ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - One of the best restaurant experiences I‚Äôve had in Ireland, and probably the best customer service anywhere I‚Äôve received.

The Batch Loaf is so homely inside, we had the half batch to start with homemade pesto, and the Potted Crab - both delicious!!

For mains we had the monkfish and prawn risotto and Duck which were amazing, the dauphinoise potatoes on the side were as good as I‚Äôve had anywhere and the mushroom onion mix was a perfect side for the duck.

The range of wines was really impressive, we had a Malbec.

The highlight of the night came when we got to dessert stage - we had mentioned on the reservation it was our anniversary - we didn‚Äôt even order dessert and they arrived out with ice cream candle and a customised plate designed in house by the staff!

When we went to pay they gave us the plate to bring home, such a nice touch and small things really do matter. The staff are all so friendly and genuinely care about how your experience was.

Batch Loaf is well worth the money, we travelled one hour to visit and we‚Äôll be back for sure. The Poc Fada pub downstairs is also really nice for a drink before and after! (by Ryan) [2 years ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Fab place to bring kids as it was all so accommodating. We had a little bit of a wait for food, but we didn't mind.

Batch loaf bread is to die for. Visit Monaghan just for this and the homemade pesto! Potted crab is unreal. Cod and prawn salad was amazing. Marinated chicken is gorgeous the curry sauce - out of this world. A Must visit in Monaghan (by Neeley Casserly) [2 years ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Best vegan risotto I've ever had! Monaghan has few options for vegans, and, even though vegan options aren't marked on the menu here, my waitress was very knowledgeable about what could and couldn't be modified and the chef did an outstanding job making an off-menu risotto for me. It was so ridiculously moreish that I probably couldn't eaten a second plate! I actually regretted not getting a serving to go for my lunch the next day.

The side of garlic bread and salad wasn't great‚Äì the garlic tasted like it came from a jar, and the salad had nothing on it (no olive oil, lemon, salt, etc.). But the risotto was so good that I didn't even care lol.

The restaurant itself is simply gorgeous, and the interior designer should be applauded. It was a lovely atmosphere to read a book in while enjoying such a tasty dinner. My waitress was very friendly and helpful. A fantastic experience all around, and a highly recommended eatery!

Arrived in Crossdoney at lunchtime. Family visited us and we just couldn't wait to go to the Shantully for dinner.  It was the obvious place to go.

The lovely young girl behind the bar remembered me.  A few minutes later, the Owner and his Wife came round to say hello.  We couldn't have got a warmer more friendly and humbling welcome.

All 4 of us ordered different meals and each of them were enjoyed.

We will definitely be back during our stay.  It is great to be back.

My Partner and I were visiting family in Cavan for 10 nights in 2 Airbnbs.  We went to the Shantully Inn most day/nights.  The food is fantastic.  Piping hot, excellent portions, great value for money and service was just second to none.  One night after the Virginia show, we stepped in at 8.45pm.  I asked if they were still saving food but the lovely young girl explained the Kitchen was shut.  The Owner stepped in.  15 minutes later, we were served 2 very hearty, piping hot, sumptuous meals.  You would not get this anywhere else and something we will not forget.  Such a lovely, humble couple.  I'm not surprised they are constantly busy and deservedly so.  No matter where we stay, we will ensure that Shantully is ""our local, our go-to"".  Your hospitality is applauded.  Special thanks must go to Caitlin.  Such a lovely young girl, an absolute credit to the team.  Nothing was ever too much trouble and service was consistent with a üòÉ Keep up the good work.

We left our food and went to the counter to complain that they had burned it and it was not edible, but they argued with us, saying nothing was wrong. They kept arguing.

After, we asked the gentleman at the counter, but he completely ignored us. We spent  money and were given food that was practically half the price. This is unacceptable.

The food and the place were great, really lovely ,  but the service was - sorry to have to say it - poor .

Service can be a deal breaker and difficult to get right . The first waitress - a Malaysian / Indonesian girl was glum . The water carafe had really wet the table and the menus , however , she made no effort to get a cloth and dry the table . Her attitude towards us was a variety of indifference and quasi hostility . She did not engage with us in any way apart from writing down our order . There was no banter , no smile , no reference to the food . We also ordered a bottle of wine between two . I clearly stated I wasn‚Äôt drinking ( as I was the driver ) but yet two glasses arrived . I felt like I was the one who did something wrong when she curtly pointed out that I needed to move my water beaker in order for her to put down the wine glass ( which I was not going to use anyway ) . We both felt almost intimidated to ask anything as feedback and engagement were apparently ‚Äò not on any menu ‚Äò !

The food arrived and it was super . That said nobody asked us if we were ok or if the food was ok or if we needed anything . We were left to our own devices . We requested assistance from three other waitresses throughout the course of the meal . Two were business like and one was just inexperienced - we left a tip but she did not even say ‚Äò Thank you ‚Äò . This was disappointing .

A more mature lady approached at one point and she was somewhat friendly . She offered to refill the water carafe but the water never arrived .

Before leaving I went up to the counter to say goodbye and thanks but  all waitresses were involved in some sort of kerfuffle and didn‚Äôt even look at me or say anything as I said my goodbye and thanks . Again  very disappointing .

This is a lovely venue and great food but sadly attention  to detail was lacking and service should be better . Maybe everyone was having an ‚Äò off day ‚Äò but these days shouldn‚Äôt really be foisted on the customers . I would definitely return because of the quality of the food and the venue itself but the service needs an upgrade . (by Noel Scott) [a year ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Excellent.

I came here for my fianc√©'s birthday and there was a great variety in the menu, I went for the onion bhaji for starter and Pork Belly roulade for mains, both really flavoursome and plated great. Beef bourguinon special was tender and the portion was huge, actually all portions are incredibly generous, I would actually say you could cut that back haha

We were too full for dessert but received a lovely Happy Birthday plate from the guys which was very generous and a nice little touch.

Cocktails are also great - a great spot much needed in Cavan.

We opted for the Early bird menu (2 courses for ‚Ç¨27.50 & option of adding a dessert for ‚Ç¨5). I was impressed that this was an option on a Saturday night until 6.30pm. Some specials were also available.
To commence, I opted for the crispy beef and truffle dim sum and my husband had the homemade black pudding croquettes. We shared each other's dishes throughout the meal in case the other ordered better! The Dim Sum was the standout winner of that round: so sapid. The croquettes were tasty though lacked some moisture as we felt they were a little dry overall.
For mains, I ordered the southern fried chicken burger with chips and the other half ordered the Thai curry with chicken served with half rice and chips. The curry was the highlight of that round: again fabulous flavour though we gave it a 9/10: some added vegetables to the curry would have been perfect.
I was at capacity at this point but my bottomless husband chose the Eaton mess. He reported it was glorious. I did taste it and the berry compote was very impressive. I enjoyed watching him eat this with pure pleasure. He gave it a 10/10.

This restaurant deserves to do well. Hats off to the chef(s). We will return and know what we will order the next time already!

Everything is clearly made with fresh ingredients and had all the right flavors. We had onion bhaje, king prawn shrimp briyani, chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, and daal. I will say, the chicken tikka masala was missing a kick of some sort and tasted more like butter chicken to me.

Dun A Ri House Hotel/McMahons Cafe Bar,Cavan,"Dunaree, Cavan, Ireland",,4.2,,,"Review 1: None - Went in starving. Ordered 2 house burgers and chips. They were 17.95 each. Thought they would be good well seasoned chef burgers. Worst burger either of us ever tasted. 2 inch thick anemic looking fatty beef mince. Not even salt was added to the mixture. We complained when paying and told them how horrible the burgers were. We would of had no problem paying what the burgers were worth. ..even a tenner each...but after complaining about the quality we were still charged full price. I'd like the owner to sit down and eat one of them horrible burgers and explain how the hell their worth 18 quid when every other hotel in the country charges 13. NEVER AGAIN.

From the moment we arrived until the moment we left we had a sublime experience.

Gary Blaithin Charlie Sharon and Tosin(not sure of his spelling!) were friendly professional and incredibly attentive to anything we needed without being obtrusive.

The room and en suite were beautiful with gorgeous furniture and an incredibly comfortable bed.

Dinner was outstanding with each course perfectly cooked and presentation second to none.

Breakfast the following morning was also outstanding and very large!

Thanks to everyone for an unforgettable experience! (by Bastable-Warren Irish-Dancers) | Review 10: None - A Culinary Experience Worth the Journey and the wait!

From the moment we stepped into MacNean House & Restaurant in Blacklion, it was clear we were in for something special. The ambiance struck a beautiful balance between refined and welcoming‚Äîluxurious without being stuffy. Crisp white table linen, tasteful decor, and a quietly elegant dining room set the tone for the evening.

We opted for the tasting menu with wine pairing, and from the very first mouthful, the flavors absolutely popped. Each course was a masterclass in precision, creativity, and balance. Dishes were beautifully presented on elegant tableware, enhancing the visual and sensory experience. The wine pairings were thoughtfully curated and elevated each dish without overwhelming it.

Before and after dinner, we enjoyed a cocktail in the beautiful outdoor seating area‚Äîa serene and stylish space that allowed us to relax and truly savour the evening. It was the perfect way to ease into the meal and to wind down afterward, extending our stay in the most delightful way.

What truly tied the evening together, though, was the impeccable service. The staff were warm, friendly, and clearly very well trained‚Äîknowledgeable about each course and wine pairing, and attentive without being intrusive. Their professionalism and genuine enthusiasm created an atmosphere that was both polished and personal.

A standout moment was when Neven Maguire himself took the time to greet guests at their tables. That personal touch made the evening feel even more special and reinforced the care and heart behind everything at MacNean House.

MacNean House doesn‚Äôt just serve food; it delivers an experience. From start to finish, it was ""wow"" after ""wow."" If you're looking for a place that treats dining as an art form‚Äîwhere every detail, from flavors to flatware, is curated with care‚Äîthis is it.
Rating: 10/10.

The noodles that came with the chicken dish were cold, dry and stuck into one lump. It was obvious that they served cheap instant noodles which they cooked well in advance and just heated a little in the microwave. The side dish of garlic potatoes (not in the pictures) would have been delicious but the potatoes were undercooked. The duck was ok but too greasy and burnt quite badly on one side. Only the fish was delicious and nicely cooked. We couldn't eat the chicken, noodles or potatoes so they took them away and offered a replacement dish but we refused. At least we weren't charged for the chicken dish. We paid for the other dishes and left immediately. The whole dinner experience was ruined. The food was way too overpriced compared to its quality.

My wife ordered the garlic mushrooms, they were overcooked and way too crispy, they were rock solid, it was inedible. I ordered the chicken Caesar salad, there was way too much dressing and not enough chicken, but it was ok.  A bit disappointing given the price.

One had eggshells inside, the other had raw bacon.
The muffins were tiny, and they charge ‚Ç¨5 for that garbage?

For that price, I can get a proper breakfast roll or something way better at any petrol station.
At least there, the food isn‚Äôt a joke.

Never again. (by Adam Rambiert) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 4 stars - I frequent this establishment and have always been mildly satisfied with my experience. One thing I have noticed is that this restaurant is highly understaffed. It has to be one of the busiest places in the town and the staff look mostly over worked but in good form . I have went for breakfast there at peak times and sometimes there is only about 3-4 staff working ? You would think a big company would surely be able to hire more staff?

Great team, great venue!

We were videographers at Farnham Estate in Cavan and from the minute we arrived we were made to feel welcome. The place itself is stunning, but what really stood out was the staff.

Cainon was brilliant, nothing was a problem and always had things moving the right way. Katie made the best coffee of the day and kept us going when we needed it. Leeann was fantastic too, serving our food right when we needed that well-earned break, small things that make a huge difference on a long day like that.

The whole team were professional, friendly, and full of good energy. Everything flowed smooth, the couple were relaxed, and the guests were looked after from start to finish. The setting is perfect for filming, inside and out, with so much space and character.

Thanks again to everyone at Farnham Estate.so looking forward to our next one here! (by Garry) | Review 4: None - Absolutely disgusted at the way we were treated , went for a spa treatment , travelled an hour to get there and my friend got called for her treatment and was greeted with a man , her face said it all !!!

Another lady looked on in horror and said she wasn‚Äôt expecting that !!!!
She said she should have been told !!!
We were NEVER told that this was going to be the case and she didn‚Äôt speak up because this was a treat for me and didn‚Äôt want to make a fuss , the man kept telling her to relax and she felt so uncomfortable throughout the whole treatment . So much so at one point she said she had to sit up as she felt she couldn‚Äôt breathe , she was that uncomfortable with the situation and how vulnerable she felt.

I wasn‚Äôt even given a robe on my arrival and had to change back into my clothes and was brought to a relaxation room fully dressed ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. the prices they charge and they can‚Äôt even provide a robe !!

When my friend went to pay for the treatments she was asked was everything ok and she said not really, she explained her situation and then that I wasn‚Äôt even given a robe etc they offered her 10% discount , seriously ????!!!!!!!!
What planet are you on that they thought 10% was suffice for this experience .
I was told she could have had a lady there, that there was one on stand by,
absolute rubbish !!

We were having lunch in the hotel afterwards so it‚Äôs not like
We were looking a freebie or chancing our arm, there was another hundred plus euro spent, I could tell how unhappy she was about the ordeal and I said sorry this simply isn‚Äôt good enough, i asked to speak to the manager of the spa and I explained the situation, I was told somebody would contact us as she was in a meeting , we waited and nobody contacted us .
We phoned back to be told by the lady on reception that she completely could understand at why we felt the way we did , this was a treat that simply turned into a very uneasy experience , something that was supposed to be relaxing and ended up being anything but !!!!
The lady on reception told us on the phone that regards to the Treatments that they have been told not to highlight that there is a possibility that it will be carried out by a man ! !!!! This is an absolute disgrace and disgusting that any female should be put in this situation , she also clarified that she took the booking off my friend and she was NOT told that it was going to be a man !!!

So the management was telling lies and making out she would have been told
When she made the booking -
NO SHE WAS NOT !!!

Still waiting on that call 6 weeks later !
The longest meeting ever !!!

It‚Äôs a case of take your money and say nothing and move on to the next poor customer that is led to believe that it is going to be a wonderful experience .

I will never be back !!!!!!!! (by Lisa Greaves) | Review 5: None - Really enjoyed my stay here. The room was lovely with plenty of space. The pool was heated which was handy because we visited in spring and the outdoor infinity part of it looks great. The spa treatments were also very enjoyable.

We went out on Saturday night last. Good crowd and atmosphere. Food Good as usual.
The problem on this occasion was:
One head woman was taken orders, serving food and drink, cleaning tablets,  basically doing everything. There were a few other staff on the floor, but not helping or in our opinion, doing enough to help this floor manager!
She was over worked! Looked stressful.
We were waiting too long for coffee & desert.
Who ever the owner/Manager is, needs to address this issue as this will do harm going forward.  Get this sorted and you will be the best restaurant in Monaghan!

Thanks: Tim (by Tim O'Hanrahan) [11 months ago] | Review 4: 1 star - Firstly, this is not strictly an Italian restaurant, as you can see from the menus, it has food from all around the globe. We were seated at our table, given menus, and in about 10 minutes the waiter arrived to ask us for our drinks order. When i asked for a wine list, his reply was ""I am the wine list, red or white"" I replied red, he gave me a list of 3 wines, Merlot, Malbec & cabernet Sauvignon.  I asked for more details on the wine, but he couldn't give me any details.  It went downhill from there. Starters ordered were The Monaghan mushrooms which were bland and unseasoned, the brie on sourdough bread, again unseasoned and light on the brie portion, with the smallest pot of pear chutney as an accompaniment. Then came our mains. One Baked Hake was overcooked and unseasoned, and one House pasta Carbonara, which came as a mountain of pasta with sauce on top, claggy pasta not very pleasant to eat. One mushroom stroganoff and one beef stroganoff, totally bland and tasteless, very little beef in the meat version. All the food lacked simple seasoning and flavour, very disappointing. Needless to say, we did not stay to have dessert. The staff were nice, but not very knowleable about the food or wine, I felt because we had queried the food and wine, they seemed reluctant to attend to our needs and we had to wait quite often to get a waiter's attention. This place could do better. (by Anna McNally) [a year ago] | Review 5: 4 stars - The food was wonderful, yet I think that the standard could have been better, especially for the given price. Portions were generous and the atmosphere was very calm. Considered the option of falling asleep in there! The Taste of Tuscany burger could have had more spice into it, and the chips certainly could have been salted further! I have one concern though... what do they put in the garlic bread? The stuff is heavenly, give me all of it!!! Definitely get the garlic bread. Please do.

Overall, I am satisfied with my experience. (by Matas Roda) [2 years ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Great fresh food cooked & presented to a very high standard.

I had the breaded mushrooms to start & the 12oz steak for mains cooked to order.  The steak came with a spinach mash which was so tasty & moreish.

Service was prompt, friendly & engaging & the atmosphere was inviting & relaxed.

I had tried to make my booking online but pre order was only letting me order up to 2.5 hours before. Decided to ring, phone was answered by staff member without any indication that it was in fact Pizza Max just an abrupt hello. I explained my query and found it very difficult to make out what he was saying he just kept saying this is Dublin, who are you, why you phone from UK number. Again I explained but to no avail just kept waffling something about his brother and Dublin and being ignorant. I waited an hour and rang back hoping I would get another member of staff but unfortunately got the same one! This time he was even more ignorant again I tried to explain and said I wanted to pre order approx 300 euro order and to make sure it was confirmed would pay by credit card upfront. He told me we only take cash on delivery who are you we can't take your order and hung up the phone. Ordered from Apache 10mins later stress free helpful staff member paid by card told me any probs call back. You just lost good business and treated me like dirt never seen customer service like it!

The food in the coffee was lovely. We ordered the fish goujon and the chicken fajitas and chips. The chips freshly cut and chunky just the way I like them. Very friendly staff. The coffees were very good. A cappuccino and a flat white. Coffee is my thing, I like strong coffee. Ground coffee is best. So the coffee shop gets 10/10 for their coffee.

The vibe was perfect, the food was incredibly tasty (with so many great veg options! üå±), and the portions were seriously generous.

A huge shoutout to the young team there‚Äîtheir warm hospitality made the evening so special. Highly recommend! (by Gokula Krishnan) [Edited 2 weeks ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Stopped in for dinner with family. The service was excellent. Had the leg of lamb it was perfect. Had the cheesecake for dessert excellent also. My whole family was impressed with the food and service. Would highly recommend for a great dinner and welcoming atmosphere. Dan from Ottawa Canada (by Killarney landscaping) [6 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Stunning. A hidden Gem üíé in rural Ireland, world class even for world class business and private type of ceremonies and events. The architecture and designer made it possible to feel having privacy and being at a quiet place though having huge spaces and lively atmosphere in the different areas of this superb facility. You cannot see it from the outside, rather go inside and experience it. A living understatement.

Small intimate seated area to front of cafe and another nice seating area to the back.

We stopped for a quick lunch during a long drive, the menu is simple and very clear. We ordered the soup of the day and three sandwiches - everything was outstanding! The kitchen is open, we could actually see how fresh everything was.
The place was SLAMMED, jam packed, with lots of patrons getting coffee and and snack to go - so it took a little time for the food to come, but it was definitely worth it. The coffee was very good as well. I was bummed that I didn't get the chicken and rice special, it looked so good! It two hours away from us, but I definitely stuck a pin in it for the next road trip.

Beverages are lower-priced than those in major chains (one is nearby), but food appears a bit costly at first. We opted for the sourdough baguette with beef and horseradish, it was well worth the price and quite a generous portion as well. Only puzzle being why a ""baguette"" would consist of two thick slices of bread ... ;) Seating might be a problem if the caf√© is busy, be advised.

Second time visit d and won't be the last. (by Chris Fox) [6 days ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - What a hidden gem of a restaurant. Yeelong‚Äôs extensive range of food was able to easily accommodate some fussy eaters amongst the group. One of our party, who considers himself the pizza doyen of South, rated the Yeelong Margarita ‚Äúthe nicest pizza in Ulster‚Äù. The ‚Äòpasta guy‚Äô wasn‚Äôt disappointed either. However, it was the Chinese eaters amongst the group who were most vocal in their collective praise. A great feed! It was all topped off by bubble tea, yum, yum (by Hilary Dorgan) [a year ago] | Review 3: 2 stars - Never had bad food from these guys. 9/10 times they are lovely, welcoming and accommodating. Never eaten in, but always collected or had food delivered. Literally just rang them there, and whoever the man was on the phone answered in the most rude way, sounded extremely irritated at my call, sighed into the phone mic and told me they're not delivering because they're extremely busy. I had to ask if I had the correct number. Fair enough, that's fine, I know it must be a pain taking orders and such, but your own issues are not the callers fault. Generally, the staff are great, but you should change whoever the man is answering that phone this evening for your own benefit. (by A Mad Superhero) [2 years ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - This is a great takeaway with a wide range of food. The food on offer is well beyond just Chinese food. Burgers, Kebabs, Fish & Chips, and Pizzas.

Their pizzas are very tasty, with freshly made bases. The pizzas in Yeelong are much better than a lot of pizza places.

They also do a range of drinks, like Slushies, Shakes and a selection of Bubble Teas.

This would be my first time to try Bubble Tea. I can't think of another place in Cavan or the surrounding counties, where I could buy a Bubble Tea. If fact I have not come across another place serving Bubble Teas in Ireland, although there must be several.

There is something on the menu for everyone, even if Chinese food is not your thing. But, if its Chinese food that you are looking for, then you will not be disappointed with their menu, flavours, quality or portions. It has all the regular Chinese dishes, and more.

Yeelong is something of a new wave in Chinese, or indeed other takeaways, in that it does so much more than just the expected Chinese food.

The diversity of food offerings, could well be the future for takeaway restaurants. More choice, more variety, and even food and drink options you would not expect to find in a local takeaway.

If you visit Killeshandra (Cill na Se√°nr√°tha - The Church of the old ring-fort) and want a takeaway then this is the place to check out. (by Dermot Kelly) [2 years ago] | Review 5: 1 star - I have to agree with the previous reviewer the toilets are a disgrace. I‚Äôm not sure how this place can call itself a restaurant because there is one table in a waiting room! The bin was over flowing and there was a young child  running around like a lunatic. We ordered our food and watched as numerous people came and went before us. When we finally got our takeaway it was really poor. The chicken curry was frozen diced chicken and the sauce was tasteless, the chilli ribs were dry as a board and the crispy chicken sweet and sour was the worst I have ever tasted.
If there was an option to give it a minus score I would. (by Karyn L) [6 years ago] | Review 6: 1 star - If it was possible to give a no star rating I would have. Two people in the place waited 20 minutes for food to go then she tells me she forgot to put the order in. Bathrooms absolutely disgusting hadn't been cleaned in months when I mentioned this to her I was told toilets not for customers yet sign on door clearly states otherwise. Won't be back. Bad attitude . Chef in back clearly frustrated by her work ethic. (by Frank Connell) [7 years ago] | Review 7: 2 stars - Probably the worst food take away store I've ever visited.

The furniture, the toilets, the sofas, just everything was not nice and somehow improvised. The food was terrible.

The staff was neither friendly nor really helpful. We waited extremely long for our food.

I highly recommend not going to this place

I most certainly won‚Äôt be ordering from them again because of the delivery fee they sneaked in!!

I‚Äôll be posting this review on fb also to warn people. (by John Moore) [2 months ago] | Review 2: 1 star - I ordered a pizza and a chicken tray, and unfortunately the experience was very disappointing. The pizza was slightly burned on the bottom while the top was cooked differently, and it was so unappetizing that I had to throw it away. The chicken tray was even worse ‚Äî it seemed to be made with leftover chicken, a few small potatoes, and large chunks of onion with a little sauce. The taste was unpleasant and the quality did not match the price at all.

Overall, I was shocked at how poor the food was, especially considering the cost. Definitely not worth it.

I ordered a Zinger Stacker burger from KFC Cavan and was shocked at how bad it was. The chicken tasted awful ‚Äì like dry, shredded fibres that had been sitting for years.

All the food was very tasty and the steaks were cooked amazingly. My salad was fresh and the bread was delicious.

I go there every lunch time it is a fantastic place for food and the ATMOSPHERE is brilliant and the female staff are unbelievably helpful. However the male bartender or manager is extremely rude and always has been towards me regardless of the fact I'm there everyday of not every second day. He rudely told me the coffee machine was off today and only beer orsger was available i asked for a frappachino and was told beer or lager only.
There was no signs for this and seemed as if it was only done as the male bartender in charge knew I would be ordering coffee. He has had a horrible attitude towards me for months and was extremely rude and made me feel unworthy to be there.

Prices went way up too. Sadly we may not come back again, if it wasn't for the big price increase we would try again as the chef could be out that day, or something may have happened to justify the very bad quality of the food, but for the new prices it does not worth the try.

Previous review:
""Perfect background music at the perfect volume, and this was the ""worst"" thing I can say about this amazing restaurant.
Food it soooo good, everything we order is presented with love, care and attention to detail, even the toilets are perfectly clean.
The best restaurant we tried in Ireland to date. My wife is finally delighted to go out for a meal. She is used to the French Restaurants and the French cuisine, she says that finally she found a place that can compete with the French quality.
We will return for sure, and won't take long, even if we live more than 50km, if worth the drive. Thank you for the lovely meal.""

Extremely Disappointed ‚Äî Unwelcoming, Unprepared, and Overpriced

Our experience at this restaurant was nothing short of frustrating. From the moment we walked in, it was clear they were not ready ‚Äî tables weren‚Äôt set, service was disorganized, and it felt like we were an inconvenience rather than valued guests.

Even worse, it was made quite obvious that children were not welcome. Subtle hints and cold glances turned into a noticeably dismissive attitude, making our family feel out of place and unwelcome. If kids aren‚Äôt allowed or wanted, that should be clearly stated upfront ‚Äî not implied through rudeness.

As for the food: shockingly small portions, especially given the outrageous prices. We left hungry and irritated, wondering how this place justifies its reputation. Quality cannot excuse a lack of hospitality, unpreparedness, and a complete disregard for the customer experience.

Not coming back ‚Äî and I would advise others, especially families, to steer clear.

Managed to visit over the Easter weekend. Really loved their vibe and beautiful setup inside. Bar lounge was cozy and comfortable to sit in for a couple of drinks before dining.
Also bar staff took our dinner order from sitting so we were able to wait while having some drinks and go in when everything was ready.
Starters and desserts were highlights of the day.
Lamb pie and prawn filo pastry were delicate and scrumptious.
Both of our main dishes, which were fillet steak and duck were both overcooked, lacking of jus so it was a little dry but portion was huge.
Desserts were baked alaska and apple crumble. Both amazingly good and really sad that it was end of our meal.
Petit four was there but one macaron and one caramel biscuit to share between two so we had to bite into each of them which isn‚Äôt really elegant if you‚Äôre dining with someone else.

The room I was given (central, top flor, old part of the building) is very large and luminous, sporting five huge windows, an extremely comfortable bed, a big desktop, a large bathroom too with a good and wide shower unit. Good view over the main street, no obstacles in front. Lots of outlets for plugging in all your stuff, including USB charge. All designed with a great taste by a good professional. A dream of a room if it weren't for what I'll write below.
There are quite a few breakfast options, all of them delicious and more than enough for the hungriest guest. Breakfast times very friendly, almost until noon. I dined in the restaurant a couple of times and I liked the food too, good and large portions. Prices are quite reasonable. The staff is correct, but nothing to call home about. Some are more obliging, some are a bit dry.

The only one -but very important- thing I didn't like (which prevents me from ticking 5* in all the ratings) was the fact that, despite having requested a quiet room when I did my booking, my request was totally ignored. Not only I wasn't given a quiet room, but actually one of the two NOISIEST rooms they have. This hotel is composed of two adjacent buildings: the old one is much nicer, but the windows are not double-glazed and, since they overlook a busy crossing, the traffic noise is very disturbing all they round, except thanks God by night; but then early in the morning it starts again. So, I had to sleep with earplugs the whole of my stay. And by daytime I couldn't peacefully read or work. At the very least the management should have explained to me why I was given such a noisy room despite my request. So, a bad note for customer service.

Food took well over an hour to arrive. Just tasted awful in general. Even heated it up and was still cold and horrible. Curry sauce brutalised with grease. If you told me it was poison I would most certainly believe you. Overall a horrible experience that has left me scarred, the food was horrible and the wait was horrible. I threw it in the bin, best place for it to go.
Bryan Sipak (by Jop Lop) [a year ago] | Review 8: 1 star - Only giving 1 star because zero isn't an option. Had the chicken tikka kebab and it was reheated dry chicken that was unedbile. The taco chips used dried lamb powder it was awful. The wait was over an hour for this absolute muck of a meal. Doner kebab was rank. The photos of the food are a lie and the people running the place aren't interested in serving good produce. (by Brigid Mulligan) [a year ago] | Review 9: 1 star - Absolutely shocking service from start to finish. Went in yesterday evening and was placing our order when the phone rang. The server then took the phone call and left us standing and was on the phone for a good 5 mins. Then continued with our order (4 meal deals and a burger) waiting for our food it took over half an hour, and I counted at least 10 customers come in, order after us and get their food quickly. After I asked how much longer, he laughed and said they were busy. Cans come with the meal deals and he tried to short change me a can too. When I pointed this out he said I had only ordered 3 and when I reeled out the 4 meal deals that came with cans he then went to check the receipt and only then gave me the 4th can. Terrible terrible service.
Only redeeming feature was the burgers were good. Chips were soggy (by Laura McMahon (Skeffs)) [Edited 3 years ago] | Review 10: 1 star - Ordered a mixed kebeb charged me 2 euro over the price on the board, next customer gets the kebab meal they only charge him 11 and his comes with a drink, seem to be charging what they want depending on the customer and I've always ordered out of here through just eat so they can't change the price I guess.

We were presented with a large plate of food each, which had our meat, creamed potatoes, chips, cabbage,  carrot and parsnip and gravy. The food was delicious and hot. First class service and food.

Shows very well run (by Carmel) [11 months ago] | Review 5: 1 star - This is a wonderful facility and only getting better. The problem is that there is zero transparency in the stable booking process for the bigger shows. Blocks of stables are very clearly reserved in advance for preferred clients and kept out of the pool when the online sale goes live. All of the stables sell out within minutes and somehow, so does the waiting list, which requires one to email the office. You'd be more likely to get Oasis tickets. There is also no forewarning about when the stables will go on sale, so unless you're part of a group chat tracking it, or have connections to the centre, you're unlikely to have the chance.

She then told me that ‚Äú there is too much going on‚Äù and went to the people next us again asking if they have ordered and are alright??!

Certainly a place to visit when events are on.
Recently the stallion inspections were hosted here and gave an opportunity for the public to come along and view the proceedings.
Nothing beats watching live show jumping. On site restaurant, with friendly chatty staff, who happily fill the plate.
Check the schedule, and attend the events. Plenty of warm clothes needed, because it can be a chilly enough place.

Gorgeous interiors, lovely staff, but 100% the people in the next room will have the walking sound effect + room shake combo as the big stone fella from Mario 64 DS.

It's a sweet little bubble if you're intentionally seeking a no-thrills getaway.

My partner and I were intentionally looking for something very mild and isolated. It's a good area for coffee dates & the hotel bar (Percy French) is very nice. Lots of takeaways very close to the hotel if you fancy something fun to bring back to the hotel.

Overall I liked it a lot. There's something special about hotels that can invoke the feeling of a liminal space. The simplicity of it is great for spending time together without  distractions or buzz from the outside world.

Edit: my partner has pointed out that we can hear & feel when people are walking on the ground floor below us. I don't know how that's possible but upon further observation I can say this is true.

Not ideal when you have to work in the morning. Walls must be made of paper. Also the breakfast doesn‚Äôt start until 0900 which is great when you‚Äôve to be in work for 0800 and the ‚Äúcontinental‚Äù before that is cardboard toast, apples that were picked in 1997 and have more wrinkles than my nan and pan au chocolates wrapped in plastic you could wedge a door with.

What a delight. From the onset we were wafted through the luxury experience by informed, professional and knowledgeable staff. The ambience within the room was intimate and relaxing. The attentiveness of the staff and the rate at which the courses were delivered was perfect. The menu itself flowed beautifully and was a fantastic explosion on the senses both taste wise and visually plus it was really important to us that a lot of the ingredients were sourced locally. I couldn‚Äôt fault any of the courses but for me the ‚Äòstar of the show‚Äô was the wild venison with currents followed by the quail and then the chocolate and poached pear.

Catalina,Cavan,"Lough Erne Resort, Belleek Road, Enniskillen BT93 7ED, United Kingdom",Restaurant,4.5,,+44 28 6632 3230,"Review 1: 5 stars - Without doubt one of the most memorable meals of our lives! Every dish was a winner. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The design of the tasting menu was so thoughtful. Best locally sourced ingredients. Clearly made with care, heart and passion. The restaurant reserves a lot of seats for booking in person when you stay at the resort. The online system might say full but there were still available tables left. And I would like to give a huge shoutout to the most attentive most friendly lady who guided us through this fantastic meal, Miss Inesa. She was incredibly kind and patient with us, knowledgable in what she does. She made our meal that much more special. Another shout out goes to Joseph (sorry if I spelt your name wrong). Overall highly recommended. A 5-course meal at this price point, at such premium quality, honestly it was well worth it! (by J Yam) [3 months ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - The food here is absolutely superb! We got a little chef special taster to start of salmon and fish egg with a paste. I'm not a fan of either normally but the flavours were amazing. The staff are lovely and really professional. Our waitress recommended a lovely wine to compliment our meal. The beef was so tender and flavoursome. A little tip about the beef I asked for medium rare but it was a little over cooked so go the next level up. Could not fault the experience even with this. Amazing! (by Julie Long) [5 years ago] | Review 3: 3 stars - Food quality was good but little disappointed. Duck was overcooked so I couldn‚Äôt cut through. I was too hungry so I really wanted to finish it but there was no taste of it. Other courses were very nice but small portion. Took over an hour to get desserts. We were too hungry just sitting there. We asked more drinks but it was also forgotten. Later on, staff says that it‚Äôs not available. Maybe too much expectation for five star hotel restaurant. Not sure I would come back. (by Eunju) [2 years ago] | Review 4: 3 stars - This is going to be a very long and very honest review. I don‚Äôt often leave reviews, but as a vegan I often rely on others‚Äô experiences, so I hope this helps someone in the future.

My husband booked a table for us a week in advance and made it clear that we‚Äôre vegan and celebrating a special occasion. He was reassured that a five-course vegan dinner would be available, which made us very excited. Catalina presents itself as fine dining, so our expectations were high.

The restaurant itself is beautiful, and we were seated at a lovely table by the window overlooking the lake, a wonderful start.

Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. When the menus arrived, we noticed only a couple of vegan options. After we reminded the waiter of our booking, he explained that the chef could ‚Äúimprovise‚Äù for us. The amuse-bouche, a refreshing melon dish gave us hope, but sadly the rest of the experience was inconsistent.

For starters, I had roasted cauliflower while my husband was given a tomato soup (not on the menu). Both were just okay, though the soup was overly sweet. For mains, we both chose the mushroom risotto. The problem? It had the exact same elements as my starter-celeriac pur√©e and truffle. In fine dining, repeating components between courses feels lazy, especially when both dishes are already on the menu and not created on the spot.

To make matters worse, the risotto was also overwhelmingly sweet and unbalanced. Perhaps the original version included cheese to cut through the sweetness, but without it, the dish simply didn‚Äôt work. At this point, every course we‚Äôd had leaned oddly toward sweet, unusual and disappointing.

The bread offered was gluten- and dairy-free, but so dry and bland that we didn‚Äôt bother eating it. It felt more like a supermarket ‚Äúfree from‚Äù loaf than something served in a fine dining restaurant. Many breads are vegan (we are not gluten free) a slice of a nice sourdough would make a difference. We were also brought thick-cut chips (which were actually very good) and a strange side of root vegetables that looked like leftovers from a broth, lightly chargrilled but completely unseasoned.

We didn‚Äôt have time for dessert as we were heading to the cinema, though honestly, another sweet dish wasn‚Äôt very appealing by then. Lack of time was our miscalculation and I would like to say that actually the slow pace of dining is something we do like.

The waiting staff were friendly and attentive, but whenever we gave feedback (such as pointing out how similar my starter and main were), the answer was always: ‚Äúthe chef tried to improvise.‚Äù Considering we gave a week‚Äôs notice and mentioned it was a special occasion, we expected more than last-minute improvisation.

We fully understand this is not a vegan restaurant, and we don‚Äôt expect a London or Berlin-style vegan fine dining experience in rural Northern Ireland. Still, with a little extra thought and effort, Catalina could become a real destination for vegans looking for a special occasion meal. At present, however, it falls short.

I‚Äôm confident meat-eaters will have a wonderful fine dining experience here, but for vegans, it‚Äôs underwhelming and unfortunately, a disappointing way to celebrate our anniversary. (by lola karolina welch) [2 weeks ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - Absolutely fantastic meal. From the amuse bouche to the passion fruit souffl√© every course was superb. Very attentive staff.

What we got would feed 4 to 6 people and it was the driest food I've ever tasted. The ribs were massive and one bite would take an hour to chew. If it was nice food we could of ate what filled us and kept the rest till the next day but if it was dry after the five minutes it took from when we ordered it to when it was ready then what would it of tasted like the next day.. I brought it back and the lady wouldn't even give 10 euro back to make up for the fact she suggested the large box of dry crap she served us. All quantity with no quality. Disgraceful.

Eala Bhan,Cavan,"5 Rockwood Parade, Abbeyquarter South, Sligo, F91 YX52, Ireland",Restaurant,4.6,,+353 71 914 5823,"Review 1: 4 stars - A fantastic meal by the river side in wonderful Sligo, fitting given the name inclusive of swans meandering downstream on arrival.

We enjoyed an absolute fantastic meal full of bountiful and locally sourced flavours. A pleasure in all. The only downside was the portion size being on the large size, fit for a burly Irish farmer of which I am unfortunately not.

This widely celebrated restaurant has the Michelin Guide firmly in its sights and with a modernised, yet charming interior refit and streamlining of an already spectacularly organic and native produce this restaurant will secure the right praise at a higher level.

Thank you, we will return. (by Alexander) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Disclaimer: I received no incentive or kickback for this review.

My family and I had a wonderful tea this afternoon. Even before our reservation, Anthony reached out to make sure there were no dietary restrictions or allergies. Upon arrival, the staff had our table ready, with a highchair by the front window. Our waitress was top notch and quickly brought us a beautiful spread of tea, coffee, sandwiches and treats. It was a very special treat for us. We would happily eat here again in the future! 10/10 (by JT Payne) [a month ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - We dined at The Ella Bhan during our European vacation, and it did not disappoint.

The food (all locally sourced) was absolutely delicious and the presentation was gorgeous. The staff were extremely friendly and professional. They have a great selection of whiskey. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and we were fortunate enough to get a table by the window looking out onto the river. Although quite pricey, they serve 5 star food that is definitely value for money, especially the pre-theatre menu (from 17:00-18:20). This was our favourite restaurant in Sligo!

Must try point if you in Sligo and I highly recommend. (by Cemre Basalp) [3 months ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - We had great food here. However I need to knock a star because of the pricing. ‚Ç¨45 for a mediocre Italian wine, that is ‚Ç¨14 street price is over priced. ‚Ç¨19 for a very small scallop starter, and beef starter with a tiny bit of beef is also overpriced and ‚Ç¨40 for lamb the same.

This is terribly poor customer service she could easily have served the 2 of us in the 5 mins left as it only take a few minutes to prepare the sandwich.

I had tried to order online a few times, but unfortunately, I was not successful in placing the order. So, I decided to go in person to place my order. The first time I went in, I was a bit disappointed that the online offers were not available in-store.However, on my second visit, the staff (different from the first time) was really friendly and helpful. They took the time to explain the different ingredients and even suggested some great offers. I must say, the pizza this time was really delicious compared to my first experience.
What impressed me the most was that I received my order within 10-15 minutes. The only downside was that I had to pay extra for the dip. Also, the street parking was a bit of a hassle, but I managed.

Tully Mill Restaurant,Cavan,"Florencecourt, Enniskillen BT92 1FN, United Kingdom",Restaurant,4.8,,+44 28 6634 9879,"Review 1: 5 stars - We really enjoyed our meal at Tully Mill. The food was quite good. We had the pork belly, salmon, roast beef, today pudding, and apple/berry crumble. Everything was excellent though I'd give a slight nod to the pork belly as the best dish of the day. Service was extremely attentive, though we often found thay different members of the staff would approach with the same question literally moments from one another. The atmosphere and overall vibe of the place was really pleasant.  Overall a terrific experience.

The restaurant is an old converted mill where a lot of the mill equipment is still installed for you to see.

It was a set menu and I chose the smoked chicken caesar salad for starters, duck leg with plum sauce and dauphinoise potatoes. To finish off I would highly recommend the chocolate brownie with salted caramel sauce and Irish cream gelato.

The staff were lovely especially Grace behind the bar who was serving us all last night she was so nice and so friendly made us really all feel so welcome. It really makes a difference when there is nice staff so that was fantastic.  The rooms are really nice clean and spacious and the breakfast was very good. The views from the hotel are beautiful too so id highly recommend anyone to stay at the Lakeside if your looking for a nice welcome spot. Hopefully visit again soon .

We had the ceremony at the lakeside because it was such a beautiful day.  The staff were amazing, especially Claire who organised the whole wedding for my son and his wife.  The food was fabulous and plenty of it.  The views from the function room looking over the lake were beautiful in the evening.  The serving staff were so friendly and nothing was too much bother.  A special thank you to Sammy our bartender who went above and beyond to serve us for the whole evening.  We would highly recommend this hotel for any function.   The breakfast next morning was great.  Well done to all the staff.  This was 5 star treatment.

We recently had our wedding at the Lakeside Manor Hotel and we honestly cannot put into words how incredible the entire experience was. From the moment we booked our date to the very last dance of the night, everything was handled with such professionalism, care, and warmth that it truly exceeded all of our expectations.

Our wedding coordinator, Claire, was nothing short of phenomenal. She guided us through every step of the planning process, always available to answer our questions and reassure us whenever we felt overwhelmed. On the big day, she was calm, organized, and attentive, making sure everything ran seamlessly so we could just relax and enjoy ourselves. Her attention to detail and genuine care made all the difference and we will be forever grateful to her.

Sammy, the main bartender, was absolutely fantastic. He brought such great energy to the evening, was incredibly efficient, and made sure that every guest was looked after. So many of our friends and family commented on how friendly and professional he was, and he really added to the atmosphere of the night.

Every single member of staff went above and beyond for us. From the servers to the reception team, everyone was kind, attentive, and genuinely invested in making our day special. Nothing ever felt like too much trouble, and the service throughout the day and evening was flawless.

The food was another highlight. From the canap√©s to the wedding breakfast and evening food, everything was cooked to perfection, beautifully presented, and full of flavor. Our guests are still talking about how amazing the meal was, and it was served with such efficiency that everyone was able to enjoy it together without any delays.

And of course, the location itself is simply breathtaking. The Lakeside Manor provides the most stunning backdrop for photos, with its serene views of the water and picturesque surroundings. The setting felt so magical and romantic, and it made the perfect venue for the most important day of our lives.

We truly cannot thank the team at Lakeside Manor enough for giving us the wedding of our dreams. It was 5-star service in every possible way, and we will cherish the memories of our day there forever. To anyone considering this venue for their wedding: do not hesitate. You will be in the very best hands, and your day will be everything you could ever hope for and more.

Very reasonably priced too. (by Margaret Forsyth) [a year ago] | Review 6: 1 star - I bought food from this restaurant on take out today (23/03/2020) using their online ordering service, and let me start off by saying that restaurants should notify customers, while ordering their food, that the items they want are out of stock, not after me driving 15 minutes to arrive at the place and been told that they do not have half the order in their kitchen. Secondly, in spite of my order not having what I wanted, they asked if i would like extra wings in my dish. When I arrived home, after nearly 45 minutes waiting to get my grub, I get home to find that the chips, are burnt to a crisp, alongside a scabby curry dip, and not very much meat in the munchy box (4 wings & 4 pieces of the sliced chicken). I went there on the recommendation of a friend after been told of the great service and nice food. It was my first time ordering the food, and it'll be the last. Very unimpressed. (by Glenn Matthews) [5 years ago] | Review 7: 4 stars - Great for a Saturday night take away (by Ned Mac Samhrain) [5 months ago] | Review 8: 2 stars - I'm afraid to say that this is my second disappointing takeaway from Ko's in the space of a few months.  About 45 minutes after placing my order I was called by them to say that they wouldn't recommend what I had ordered and offering a substitute,  fair enough I thought, they informed me that the delivery would take an extra 45 mins. In fact it took over an hour, when delivered the food was lukewarm at best, the duck was fatty, stringy and cold, my partner couldn't eat it. My sichuan dish was tasty, but again tepid. The only extra they had thrown in for free, due to the extended wait, was an extra bag of prawn crackers, which we neither needed nor wanted. In summary a very dissatisfying meal. There are many Chinese takeaways in Cavan, Ko's need to look to their laurels.  I will not be using their service again.

Our food was gorgeous as well (we got the steak and my god it was yummy!)

Pool was great as well and we went down first thing in the morning and it was so peaceful and quiet. Lovely walk around the grounds too (by Andrea) | Review 3: None - This is beautiful place. The grounds are stunning, spreading for miles.
We spent full day relaxing in spa in variety of rooms and the amazing indoor outside pool.  The treatments were very professional.

Pauline one of the staff was very kind with outdoor drinks and cake and we ended up staying longer! It's a place where time stands still.
I enjoyed the fact that there are several areas you can relax in, with plenty of teas and coffee. The food in our package was gorgeous.  Not a massive portion but tasty.

Hope to come back (by Irene Curley) | Review 4: None - I stayed at the Farnham Estate Hotel recently to celebrate my mother‚Äôs 64th birthday, and while the hotel itself is beautiful, what truly made the experience memorable was the outstanding service from Bernie.

I had to leave very early in the morning for work and knew I would miss breakfast. When I mentioned this to Bernie, she immediately went down to reception to ensure that breakfast would be ready for me at 6:30am when I was leaving. But she didn‚Äôt stop there. She also went to the kitchen herself and prepared a packed lunch for me to take on my journey, and even provided me with a takeaway coffee cup so I could make myself a coffee before heading off.

This level of thoughtfulness and care went above and beyond anything I expected. Bernie turned what could have been a stressful early morning into a smooth, warm experience. She truly represents the very best of Farnham Estate‚Äôs hospitality.

I only wish I had cash on me at the time to give her the tip she so thoroughly deserved. Bernie made my stay extra special, and I cannot thank her enough for her kindness and professionalism. (by Sean Kirwan) | Review 5: None - Lovely hotel,  the spa is fantastic  the grounds are lovely.  The only thing that let it down for us was the evening meal.

(by Gary Mc Cullagh) | Review 6: None - Farnham Estate are absolutely exceptional when it comes to organising weddings. My wife and I thought the setup was brilliant: the huge function room, the outdoor wedding area, the spa, the sheer amount of rooms and houses available on site - fantastic. What will always stick with me though is just how good the staff are. The team at Farnham seriously know how to do weddings and work incredibly hard to make your big day as memorable as possible! A huge thanks to everyone in the team, with particular shoutout to Margaret, Rachel, Cainon, Paddy and Emmanuel in the Cellar Bar. You won't regret booking Farnham for your big day! (by Andrew Bond) | Review 7: None - Fantastic location. The pool and scenery are fantastic. This is our 5th time staying at the hotel. We normally love staying here  but the cons out weighted the pros on this  trip. The menu wasn't great in either maxwell grill or central restaurant which is unusual normally we love the food. I ended up ordering 2 starters and didn't eat much of either in cedars.  My husband had steak and it was excellent. Both nights the bar and restaurants were very under staffed. Breakfast on day two there was two male supervisors and the service was a million times better. Our room was not made up after the first night. The barman was very rude to us when we tried to get drinks after our dinner. Although there is beautiful scenery I dont think we will be back. (by eva mccloskey) | Review 8: None - This place is absolutely flawless.

From the minute you arrive it's perfect. The music playing and smells relaxs you instantly. Check in/out was a breeze.

The rooms are beautiful, comfortable, and absolutely spotless.

You could spend hours in the spa in the pool and multiple terminal suites. The beautiful scenery and walking routes are another great way to totally switch off.

We had dinner in an on-site restaurant, Maxwells. The food was divine, and our server Bernie was one of the highlights of our stay. Every single staff member was so welcoming!

We arrived on Paddy's Day and enjoyed some music in the Cellar Bar, which is a really cool bar.

Will definitely be back. Best hotel in the country! (by Nathan Doyle) | Review 9: None - Excluding the restaurants and the food, it's mid; the food is exceptional. Sticky floors, floors that haven't been vacuumed, old, rusty plumbing, chips and cracks everywhere on walls, dusty windowsills, odd practices. It's affordable nearly posh if that makes sense. The staff are extremely friendly and well-mannered, they know their stuff and are willing to make your life easier. (by Micz) | Review 10: None - We had a lovely stay here recently , very nice rooms (they were quite warm, no aircon , but we got a fan from reception which helped)

Staff were all incredibly nice and helpful, one bar servicing the whole hotel left for some longer wait times for drinks but still nothing major .

Food in the restaurants was very nice , some odd menu options but the mains were all great, particularly in the steak restaurant.

The breakfast buffet was amazing, probably the best selection I've had in a hotel stay in Ireland , fresh, good quality food from cooked, cold and dry options.

The spa is amazing , the pool , indoor and out is so relaxing , the grounds are also beautiful , lots of great trails to walk

(by Juthathat Kugasemrat) [a month ago] | Review 2: 5 stars - Just popped in at lunch time for a swift half on a recommendation. Couldn't stop long.The staff told me there was live folk music that evening (Wednesday). Would have liked to stay for that. Definitely on the list for our next visit. Dogs are allowed but only in the tiny snug by the door. (by Colin Nelson) [2 months ago] | Review 3: 5 stars - Beautiful listed building Amazing staff, very friendly and knowledgeable manager with regards to the wide range of whiskeys Blakes has to offer.
Relaxed atmosphere with various off set booths.
Highly recommended for a visit and if you get a chance, try a few of the recommended whiskeys or gins of the month.

For all you Game of throne fans...... See what you can spot within the pub.

Edit: 28/09/24.
Revisited Blakes as we were down to do the boatyard distillery tour and called into Blakes after, once again, the staff were very friendly and welcoming, I approached the manager and asked for his recommendations, excellent choice as always.

Well done guys and girls.

until next time! (by Stewart Harper) [Edited a year ago] | Review 4: 5 stars - We did a few bars in our 3 night stay. The quality of guinness here deserves a note. It was quite busy when there and we noticed that at one stage every single person with a pint was drinking Guinness. That's a rare sight and good to see. The black stuff must outsell other brands by at least 10 to 1 here. (by Stephen) [11 months ago] | Review 5: 5 stars - We stopped here for a pint of Guinness. Amazing place, original private cabins to have your drink, nice Halloween decoration. If you are in Enniskillen, you should go there! (by Paula Gross Stecca) [a year ago] | Review 6: 5 stars - Best Pub in Enniskillen! Also the best pint of Guinness. Bar staff all friendly. Special mention to Bobby who artistically puts a shamrock on top of a fine pint of the black stuff!

Love this wee spot! Worth a trip if you‚Äôre a Game of Thrones fan. One of a select few locations around the country with a G.O.T door made from a tree that fell at The Dark Hedges! (by Chris) [a year ago] | Review 7: 5 stars - Brilliant pub, live music on wednesday evening. Great range of drinks and really friendly staff. (by Melanie Phan) [5 months ago] | Review 8: 5 stars - Whenever you visit Enniskillen, Blakes of The Hollow should be a mandatory stop when you come here for a great pint.

A lovely historic pub which has one Game of Thrones door that was used for filming in one season.

As it was my third visit overall, the pub manager immediately recognised me and this made me feel even more welcome. Staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming and I am happy that they kept these great standarda

I will definitely be back soon and, why not, even sample some food rather than sticking only to beer. (by Enrico Monti) [6 months ago] | Review 9: 5 stars - Blake‚Äôs has been very consistent in how it runs for many years now. Training the new staff well and continually providing the best service is clear to be seen.
