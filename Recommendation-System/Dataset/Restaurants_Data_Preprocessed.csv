My girlfriend and I were in town today around lunch time and we decided to go to the “Roundy bar” to sit down and watch the world go by. As neither me or my girlfriend  wanted to drink alcohol she got us two waters and sat outside. At this time we were not made aware by any staff or signs that you need to spend money in order to sit in the bars seats outside. While we were chatting and minding our own business, a lady who seemed to be somewhat in charge but not a manager came out to us and asked us, had we purchased anything from the bar. We informed her we got two waters but she re-asked had we bought anything and we said no. She didn’t even bother to inform/ ask us could we buy something and spend money in order to sit down ( which we would have no problem with). Instead she began to belittle us and treat us as if we were dirt on her shoe while laughing that we can’t sit here as we spent no money. This lady then returned inside and we decided to continue drinking the two glasses of water which we were served inside the same bar without a problem. The lady came back out  and asked us “are we moving on yet “to which I replied “what did we do wrong” . He also informed her that we only occupied 1 table and there were only 3 other occupied tables outside and the bar which was quiet AND EMPTY.All we wanted was to sit down and watch the world go but we were wrong for only getting water ? The lady had little to no response and then snatched what was remaining of my girlfriends glass of water and went inside, also after asking for her name she laughed into my girlfriends face saying “I don’t need to tell you that girl”. In shock and embarrassment of how we were treated, we left immediately.

It happened to be my first time trying cider, and I'm delighted to say it was a delightful choice. The cider was perfectly crafted, striking a harmonious balance between sweetness and crispness that left me longing for another sip.\n\nThe pub itself exuded a friendly and inviting atmosphere.

Immersed in the authentic Irish ambiance, I couldn't help but appreciate the genuine sense of camaraderie and enjoyment that permeated the air.\n\nThis impromptu visit to the Irish pub left a lasting impression on me. The attentive and amiable service provided by the barmaid, along with the exceptional Irish apple cider, contributed to a truly memorable experience. I relished every moment, immersing myself in the rich tapestry of Irish tradition and hospitality.\n\nIf you find yourself exploring the Port of Cork, I wholeheartedly recommend paying a visit to this charming pub.

Having said that, if you are an American make sure you account for the fact that you are not going to be expected to add 30% as a tip.  We live in the DC area and the prices were comparable for us.  IF you know DC, think Old Ebbits Grill for price and overall feel.\n\nThis is a steak place.  I recommend getting the steak.  That said, SO got the salmon and it was excellent.  You can see from the pictures my steak was perfectly cooked.  Deserts were just as perfect.  I got the pear with sorbet and added the Pear Shaped cocktail.  I have a dairy allergy and I was over the moon that they had a dairy free desert.\n\nStaff was excellent and so was the atmosphere.\n\nDespite being a truly upscale dining experience we did not feel out of place in travel clothing.

As it happens with all things cooked with garlic, the garlic was so prominent that could only taste it!!!. if I had chosen any cheaper beef the taste would have been the same! While this primary mistake could be okay (it happens after all), the problem came when I told the manager that the chef should avoid that. The manager said that it was impossible, that there was no garlic in the kitchen, insisting I was wrong (and therefore crazy!). This was so disappointing. Instead of accepting what I said, the manager decided to gaslight me. I also ordered a very rare meat and they brought it medium-medium rare. I spent lots of money in a very amateur meal.

We had a lot of options to choose from in deciding where to eat as Cork has an absolute wealth of amazing vegan friendly places.  While it was difficult to choose, we opted for Sonflour, a completely vegetarian and mostly vegan Italian restaurant in the main shopping area about halfway between the North Channel and the South Channel of the River Lee.\n\nWe were blown away with our whole experience there.  The ambiance is just so far removed from that which we've encountered locally in the states, it was quaint, charming, rustic and all things in-between.  Italian food is one of those cuisines that can be challenging to find vegan options so we were intrigued with the idea of a whole restaurant dedicated to vegetarian/vegan food Italian fare.\n\nFor starters, we ordered what I believe to be Focaccia Bread but I forget the ,specific menu name.  Being a big fan of seaweed, I had to order their \""Better Call Saul..ad\"" (get it? saul..ad .. salad ... lol :) ) \""A small fresh salad, made with local Seaweed, Rocket, Carrots, Cherry Tomatoes, Balsamic Vinegar, Seeds, Truffle oil and Vegan Mayonnaise.  Both were absolutely a divine treat on the palate, bursting with flavor, true story!\n\nFor our main dish, we both ordered Ravioli, Sandi having ordered the \""Vintage sauce - Our Slow Cooked Tomato Sauce made with Fresh Vegetables and Mediterranean, Herbs, Basil Leaves and Evoo\"" and for me, the \""Sunflower’s soul sauce - Homemade Fresh Vegan Pesto, Baked Roasted Potatoes, Cherry Tomatoes and Evoo, Pine Nuts and Edible Flowers\"".  Words cannot hope to do these dishes justice so I'll simply say, the dish melted in our mouths!\n\nFor dessert, we chose \""Affogato Italian coffee-based dessert. 2 scoops of Vegan Local Vanilla Ice Cream drowned with a shot of our hot Organic Espresso Giuliano\"". You need simply look at the attached picture to know everything you need to know about how good this was.\n\nWe simply could not be happier with our choice of cuisine while in Cork.

Starter plate came with water on it… had to wipe it away with napkin; while we were having the starter, the staff already brought our main and apologized that their main was cooked too quickly - at that point, we already felt rushed by the staff.

And to top it off, we had to carry the bottles to our table ourselves, basically self-service even for the Prosecco.\n\nThe barbecue was decent, and the food was okay. We had booked for around 15 people, but only 12 actually had the barbecue. Still, the manager insisted we pay for all 15 portions because they claimed the food was already prepared. I get that, but it would’ve been nice if they’d told us upfront that they’d cook for 15 no matter what. At least then we could have figured out a way to use the extra food or save it for later.\n\nWe spent the whole afternoon and evening there, eating and drinking, which added up to quite a bill. When it was time to pay, I asked the manager if we could take the leftover food for dinner since we’d paid for it. What they gave us was really disappointing cold, dry meat that seemed like it had been out for ages, just wrapped in foil with bread. No chips, no salad, nothing.

So with that said, I never have high hopes regarding the service but overall I have enjoyed the food.\n\nThis evening I was really looking forward to treating myself to some sushi as I had some child free time. Upon entering I placed my order and as I was waiting to ask the staff member for a straw, I took a short video of the sushi on the display counter to send to my friend. There was no member of staff near me or even in the direction I was filming. As I was still waiting for service I could see the two women talking and frowning to one another until eventually the owner came to me and asked me why I was recording in her restaurant. I was honestly in such shock and taken back by the tone at which she approached me. I told her I took a short video of the sushi to send to my friend, which she again asked why, and replied that it was a strange thing to do! Implying I some kind of nefarious motives for doing so which was absolutely not the case. She also implied I had recorded her staff member and I have no idea why they thought this- or why I would want to do this? Obviously this video was taken as I liked the display! She said ‘did you not see the sign on our door’ to which I said no, clearly I did not. I looked for a sign as I left but didn’t see one then either so maybe make a bigger sign of it’s this much of an issue? To go out of your way to embarrass and argue with someone when it’s pretty clear they are not doing anything malicious is pretty crazy and a sure way to lose customers. She went on asking why I did this once again highlighting how it was strange behaviour on my part! Clearly trying to embarrass me and continue an argument. I was speechless because in this day and age- is it really strange to take photos or videos in a restaurant? They even have a whole section of their own instagram dedicated to customers photos/videos. I also sent them the recording I took to prove that nobody was in it. She then told me I was getting defensive- and when I tried to diffuse the situation by saying I think it was a misunderstanding and that she got the wrong end of the stick- she snapped back at me. You really couldn’t make it up. There were so many better ways she could of approached this situation but unfortunately she choose a bad one, hence my negative review.  If she had kindly told me they didn’t like videos being taken on the premises that is no problem- instead she chose to accuse me of videoing a staff member with zero proof, keep prying at me and insinuate what I did was weird when it was not.\n\nI was so mortified as all the other customers overheard the whole thing and were clearly made feel uncomfortable also. I sat down to wait for my food as I didn’t want it to ruin my evening, however the atmosphere was noticeably bad and I was made to feel very unwelcome for the duration of my meal. I would say this is the strange behaviour- not mine.\n\nI can confirm I will not be back and will be telling others to avoid."", ""sentiment"": ""Mixed""}]"

I had been wanting to visit this restaurant for the past 4 years living in Cork. Overall, I am slightly disappointed in all areas. Especially, considering its prestige and price. Starting with the food: although enjoyable; there is a lot of room for improvement. I personally tried the scallops, the duck, and the apple parfait. The scallops lacked depth of flavor, and were in my opinion overcooked. The acai sorbet, although a nice and refreshing idea, lacked any memorable qualities or garnish. The duck, although juicy and cooked right in the middle, had a very soggy skin. The orange flavor that was meant to complement it was also very mild. The desert was my favorite dish, and it was unique and tasty but my partners desert, the berry mousse, had (literally) half a strawberry served with it, then the menu said \""served with fresh berries\"". The wine selection was impressive and I enjoyed our drinks, although our first pinot grigio was noticeably cheap.\n\nThe service was a mixed bag. All the servers and staff were very friendly and I have no complaints in that regard. That said, we all came with heavy coats, and no one offered to pick them up for us. Additionally, we were all asked to order desert off the bat, which is unusual and delayed our order. Finally, when we left, we had to pick up our coats our selves.\n\nFinally on the atmosphere. This historic building should receive the utmost of respect and attention in decor. The flooring, armchairs, curtains, chandeliers and room layout did not honor its history. The small details, such as lighting, and set up (uninviting spotlights, grey plastic laminate flooring, one candle per table that weren't turned on etc..) do not reflect the class the restaurant should hold.\n\nOn a positive note, the live piano was lovely, and added to the experience, especially because the player himself was not only lovely, but also also highly skilled. That said, the repertoire should be adjusted, as we were confused when they started playing the game of throne TV show intro music, instead of perhaps soft jazz, or classical pieces.\n\nOverall, I did have a great time, and i don't have anything negative to say about any particular staff, or their friendliness, but considering this restaurant is within a 5 star hotel, with a very high price range, i did not feel this was reflected in the areas stated above.

I even gifted them a framed present once as a small thank-you for their hospitality, and I've always been polite and respectful in return.\n\nOn one of my recent visits, I was there with two friends to say goodbye to someone moving back to Spain. We were sitting outside enjoying the sun and I recorded a short video from outside to remember the moment. Everything seemed fine, and it was, at the time.\n\nA few days later, I stopped by again after shopping to unwind with a pint and meet a friend. I had my first drink and was about to order a second when I was told—rather unexpectedly—that I was barred. I was quite taken aback, especially since no explanation was given. I was simply told that I’d need to speak to the manager, who would be in at 6pm.\n\nWhat surprised me most is that there was no clear reason offered, and up until that moment, I’d never had a negative interaction with anyone there. The team has always been great, so I can only assume this decision came from management. If the video I took from outside was the issue, I find that a bit confusing, as there was nothing inappropriate or disruptive about it.\n\nIn the end, while it’s disappointing, there are plenty of other great places in Cork to relax and enjoy a drink.

And it doesn’t stop there — on a previous visit, I was nearly short-changed €20, which was brushed off with a casual “oops 🙃.” That alone should have been enough to never come back, but I gave you another chance. Clearly a mistake.\n\nThis experience was infuriating from start to finish. I left hungry, angry, and completely disrespected.

The woman sitting at a tablw near me with a child was left waiting ages to be served, then had to ask for culery, a portion of chips came along for her table. She then had to ask when the rest of the food was coming - she had orderd fish and chips. The one excellent and compentent server had to check on it for her. After the two had finished we had a quick chat. She said to me after that they didn't even bring the right sandwich for the child but she didn't have the energy to say anything.\nMy own order was a glazed ham and melted brie sandwich. At least that it what the menu said. What arrived was a plain slice of bread with relish and cold slice of brie, topped with a deli sized slice of ham. The portion of chips I ordered on the side came along first, with the server saying \""Enjoy your meal,\"" instead of saying \""Is there anything else I can get you?\"" Having seen the experience of the lady near me, I too had to enquire if my sandwich was on the way.\nThis quality and service as mentioned above does not reflect the quality and standard expected from a 4 star hotel. If management of the hotel is reading this, please take time to train your staff properly i.e. getting an outside agency to train them rather than relying on more senior staff to do it and/or hire more staff.\nI would recommend you take a look at how one of the city's other 4 star hotels trains and manages their staff i.e. The Metropole.\nThanks for reading,\nI hope it is useful feedback to help you to improve your service. I want to reiterate that when a place is understaffed and undertrained that this is never the staff's fault but management's fault."", ""sentiment"": ""Mixed""}, {""username"": ""Dave Deasy"", ""user_id"": null, ""rating"": 2, ""date"": ""Edited 2 years ago"", ""review_text"": ""Poor selection of food just before lunch.

I suppose the ambience makes up for a lot but imagine if everything was delicious and you could have the ambience. I am a guest at the hotel and I also had breakfast here and it was not great. It was super slow to be seated and the buffet was not replenished and service was just slow. This is an example of way to busy and not enough staff which is a management problem.

The price is a little higher than the previous evening menu they had, but it is worthy if you want to try something different and food was beautiful.\n\nIf you want to get an idea of the food they serve, have a look at its Instagram account @thebookshelfcoffee as they are ver active there, and everything you will see it is honestly what you will find in the restaurant.\n\nThe staff is so friendly you will feel like home, and they welcome you with a smile.

In a wonderful display of hospitality, they actually paused their performance to greet us personally and make us feel welcome—something you don’t experience every day! It’s these little gestures that really set this pub apart and made us feel like we were part of the family.\n\nThe owner of the pub was equally generous, going out of his way to ensure our comfort. In fact, when we couldn’t find a seat, he offered us his own chair, an act of kindness that made us feel truly valued as guests. It’s rare to encounter such genuine hospitality, and it made our experience even more special.\n\nAs for the selection of drinks, they offer a fantastic variety of beers that caters to all tastes. Whether you're a fan of local craft brews or international favorites, you'll find something to enjoy here.\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with beautiful, thoughtful decoration that creates a relaxed, yet vibrant space. The pub's interior has a charm that makes it feel both timeless and contemporary, offering a perfect setting for a quiet drink or a lively night out.\n\nA final mention must go to the barman, who made our visit even more memorable. Not only was he of incredible advice on the nightlife in the city, but his sense of humor and hugging skills made him the best bartender we encountered in Cork. A true testament to the pub's friendly vibe, he helped make our time at The Abbot’s unforgettable.\n\nOverall, The Abbot's Ale House is a must-visit for anyone in Cork looking for great beer, warm hospitality, and a cozy space to relax and enjoy the local culture.

I replied, \""since when is agriculture and economy politics\"". So off on the wrong foot from the get go.\n\nAfterwards, there was a gap of 2 seats between myself and the Irish local and when some tourists walked into the gap to order, the owner said, \""Shh, be quiet, they're ordering\"". The Irishman closed the gap by sitting next to me and we continued our farm-like banter to the dismay of- again, the owner.\n\nLater on, a Finnish friend of mine and I were talking military subjects, and I mentioned my previous military training back in the states, which includes mock battles in the desert, gun range target practice, and receiving gun certifications. The Russian owner then absolutely lost the plot and got a fingers length away from my face and said aggressively \""Don't lie, don't lie, I served in the Russian armed forces and worked for Interpol\"" to which I replied \""They didn't teach you to listen did they, I said trained with military guys and have some firearm training and certifications, never said I served, that's called stolen valour and is a felony\"".\n\nEven the Irish farmer was fed up and left the pub.\n\nThe owner also closed the pub at 10:00pm (which is illegal) due to a yellow status thunderstorm which amounted to a little drizzle for 2 hours.\n\nIn summary, you can find these unique beers at several other pubs in Cork city, (like the Bierhaus) and not have to experience the abuse , suppression of free speech, illegal closing times, and boring atmosphere of the most overrated pub in Cork city.\n\nIs this a pub or The Gulag?"", ""sentiment"": ""Bad""}, {""username"": ""Soundy Sound"", ""user_id"": null, ""rating"": 3, ""date"": ""2 weeks ago"", ""review_text"": ""It's an interesting pub, no doubt but the prices are ridiculous when compared to other craft beer bars in the city. €8 for a 5.5% Irish IPA? €4 for a half pint or Irish red??

Both he and his staff have created a unique pub with a very casual atmosphere on the corner across from the North Gate Bridge where you will feel right at home with yhe locals.\n\nEvents:\nThere is always something going on between the weekly Wednesday quiz and any number of fun filled events that take place on the weekends. There is always a raffel after the Wednesday quiz and usually the top prize is either a Nicholas Cage or a Keanu Reeves themed pillow cover or t-shirt.\nYou'll definitely find something that will tickle your fancy.\n\nLayout:\nThe main bar is on ground level with seating at the bar as well as tables and chairs along the wall. There is also additional seating upstairs however, choose wisely if its a Wednesday night as there is fierce rivalry between the two levels.\nWhat I find a bit unique for a Cork pub is that the restrooms are located downstairs.\nThere is a small amount of seating out front of the bar which is lovely on a nice sunny day to enjoy a cold drink.\n\nDecor:\nThis is a unique pub for Cork as it is decorated with everything that is Nicholas Cage! From movie posters to homemade 3-D printed heads this pub has got it all.\nThey regularly have game nights where new decorations are added to the walls and ceiling so what is there this week may have changed by next week however, Nicholas Cage remains a constant.\n\nDrinks:\nThey don't serve the mainstream beers here but what you will find is a wide variety of local and not so local beers both on tap and in can form.\nPersonally I'm a stout and cider guy but I have come to love the Indian Summer beer and Kirin Ichiban beer along with the Stag Stout to name a few.\nIf you want someyhing a little stronger they also have a wider variety of local distiller's whiskeys, gins and vodkas so there is something for everybody.\n\nOverall Opinion:\nOver the years I've come to love many pubs in Cork but none as much as the Friary!

Nothing major, but small details, like checking in more often or being quicker with service would have made the experience feel that bit smoother.\n\nAs for the food, the eggs Benedict was nicely presented and the portion size was just right for a brunch dish. The salmon was fresh, and the eggs were cooked well, though personally I found the overall flavour quite salty, which took away slightly from the enjoyment.\n\nThe orange juice was delicious and tasted freshly squeezed, but at €4.50 for a small glass, it did feel overpriced compared to the rest of the meal.\n\nOverall, it was a pleasant first experience.

From the beginning, the restaurant did not meet the standard I was expecting. The portion sizes were surprisingly small and not reflective of the price charged. The food itself was poorly prepared, tasted processed, and lacked freshness. Unfortunately, we could not finish our meals due to both the unpleasant taste and presentation.\n\nWhat made matters worse was the attitude of the manager. Rather than being welcoming or professional, they came across as impolite and dismissive. At one point, we were even charged more than what we had ordered, and only after raising the issue was the mistake reluctantly corrected. This left a very negative impression of both the management and the establishment’s approach to customer service.\n\nIn terms of value, the pricing is excessive for what is essentially frozen, low-quality food. The limited selection of drinks only added to the disappointment. The restaurant’s cleanliness was also far below acceptable standards. I noticed stains on the walls, spills that hadn’t been cleaned, and even ketchup marks on the ceiling. The overall environment felt neglected and unhygienic, which made it uncomfortable to sit and eat.\n\nThe customer service did nothing to improve the situation. Staff seemed disinterested and unengaged, and there was no effort to make customers feel welcomed or looked after. Given the lack of quality in the food, the poor service, and the unsanitary atmosphere, I cannot recommend Shake Dog. I left not only dissatisfied but also with an upset stomach, which further confirms the poor quality of the food being served.\n\nThis experience was highly disappointing from start to finish.

My friend asked the waitress and she said they used to serve it, but now they no longer serve it. From the reviews and photos, we were misled to believe that it is a fine-dining restaurant, so it was a disappointment to see only soba/ udon/ donburi, all the standard fare in most Japanese restaurants.\nWe ordered a duck dish to share, which was quite big but slightly chewy. My tempura soba was ok but the broth was too salty for my taste. However, my companion was very upset about her Karaage don because she said that her rice was soggy.

I requested bar seating so had front row view of the efficiency and attention to detail the kitchen staff took to everything from expedite to managing the front of house staff.\n\nWord to the wise their small plates showcase the immense talent of Aishling and her chef de cuisines:\n\nFor my order :\n\nTaiwan fish nuggets; beautiful rendition on my childhood favorite Taiwanese popcorn chicken, which uses white pepper for nostalgia feel that always sparks joy. Goldie's take has more Indian spices which was lovely and the fish was fried to perfection, not greasy whatsoever. How Chef Anna didn't get the famous basil pop in the oil, I'll never figure out....perhaps that's why she gets paid the big bucks! Incredible technique.\n\nCod schnitzel; gherkin and celeriac combo is one of my favorites with a twist by adding more Dijon mustard reminded me of my last trip to Lyon. Soy sauce cured egg yolk will add the additional saltiness the dish craves on anything fried.\n\nPibil cod head & cheek sope; the sope was one of the best executions I've seen since Pujol's (MXC) version. How this dish doesn't become soggy and gross speaks to their talent.\n\nMain: pan roasted to perfection monkfish with beetroot achar, apple katkut - look my pictures. un fing real. Monkfish is seldomly seen in the states and when I do make it it's usually chopped up in congee with tons of ginger and scallions. Love this French? take of this ugly ass fish lol\n\nFish tends to be a lighter option for dinner, so with any luck you’ll have room for dessert; i was completely stuffed by made the right decision in ordering caramelized white chocolate with the Achill Island sea salt and milk sorbet and the bucket wheat cracker. Unbelievable touch that was light air and not cloying.\n\nWhilst sitting at dinner I found out Chef Aishling was recently awarded Ireland's Best Chef 2024 and Goldie is listed as the #2 restaurant in Ireland's Top 100 restaurants. The Bib Gourmand rating is what brought us here, and they were absolutely correct.\n\nChef Rob - expedition was exceptional. His command of the job came second nature to him, being able to manage several chefs and front of staff. Giving meaningful instruction without being overly dominant yet letting his young staff express  their creativity is what talented Chefs do. Really appreciate him coming by to check up on me after the service.\n\nChef Anna - plating was gorgeous and really appreciated her time expanding on each dish to me in person, such a lovely hospitality touch. This is totally an aside, but she was the most beautiful woman I've ever seen on my trip to Ireland. she's an absolute beauty.\n\nFront of staff was excellent - I showed up 30 mins early to my reservation but suggested I grab a drink over at Brennan's.

You can soak up the atmosphere of this bar from anywhere inside and we had a wonderful evening with our friends in Callanan's!\n\nThe Staff:\nThe staff are very friendly here and the service is very quick. They like a bit of chat too and are a wealth of information if you get talking to them when its quiet.\n\nLayout:\nThe layout of the bar is pretty simplistic. There is esentially just one main room with a little snug at the front on the right as you enter. There is a little room at the back of the bar however, it is very small and only has a few tables and chairs.\nThe bar counter is located in the main room at the right hand side and the seating along with tables are mainly along left hand side of the room.\nThe snug like all other snugs can only take 4 or 5 people but if you are lucky to get into it not only will you have your own seperate access to the bar but its probably the best place to sit in the bar in general.\n\nDecor:\nCallanan's is another one of Cork's old timey bars and it is decorated in such fashion too. The walls are lined with timber panelling and there are a couple of pictures dotted along the walls however, the decorating is kepth mostly plain and simple.\nThere are no tvs in this bar which is nice as this bar is where people come for conversation and a few sociables!\n\nPop Up Gaeltacht:\nI came here once in my college days as a few friends were Irish speakers and they had heard about the Pop Up Gaeltacht that was taking in Callanan's that particular night.\nIt was a brilliant experience to talk and share stories with people who ranged from basic conversation to a fluent grasp of the Irish language and ever since then I have wanted to come back.\nI asked the bar man when I visited a few weeks ago if the Pop Up Gaeltacht was still going and sure enough it was being held that very night in another pub in Cork city.\nIf you are interested check out PopUpGaeltacht on Instagram or Facebook.\n\nLocation:\nIts located on the corner of Mary St. and George's Quay oppiste Parliament Bridge.\n\nOverall Opinion:\nI highly recommend stopping by Callanan's Bar for a pint of Murphy's and Beamish and the pints were flowing the night we were here.\nIf Guinness is more your thing, they have bottles of Guinness that you can order.

We had two people coming to the bar so we needed a bigger table, and I asked the staff if it was okay if we moved to another table or just brought up another chair to where we were already sitting. He offered a place in the back but it was smaller, so I said we could squeeze in another chair and fit one of them in the bench, and everything seemed fine. Then my friends came and tried to bring a chair and he was beyond rude and said we could only sit in the back.

After all, I’ve lived everywhere from the East Coast to the West Coast of the U.S., spent a few years in Texas (for context, not a fan of Tex-Mex), and even crossed the border into Mexico a few times—so I was ready for something familiar.\n\nUnfortunately… this wasn’t it. I’m honestly not sure what part of Mexico this food claims to represent, because the flavors didn’t match anything I’ve had. It tasted a bit more like if an Italian and a Mexican got married, raided the pantry, and stirred spaghetti sauce into the beans. My daughter, ever the food philosopher, argued it was actually Indian fusion. Either way, it wasn’t quite the experience we’d hoped for. Maybe we should have stuck to the little taqueria we saw down the street.\n\nOn top of that, the service left us feeling a bit invisible. We don’t drink much, so after we were seated and our food arrived, we basically didn’t see anyone again for about half an hour—no water refills, no “is everything okay?” Meanwhile, other tables around us were getting checked on regularly. And hey, we’re a fun family! We would’ve happily chatted.\n\nOh, and the glassware… yikes. One of the glasses had stuff stuck to both the outside and inside. When I asked the waiter for a clean one, he just walked over and swapped it from another table. I couldn’t help but feel bad for whoever got stuck with that trade.\n\nAll in all, Café Mexicana has a cool vibe, and maybe it hits the spot for some. But for us, it was a bit of a letdown.

It was a Tuesday, just after 7 and it was packed inside. Luckily, there was an outside table for the three of us, and they were able to accommodate a stroller.\n\nFor drinks, I was looking forward to a Guinness, but they didn't have. So instead, I had the Angel stout, which was very smooth. It was a bit darker and a little more bitter than Guinness, but still good. For food, we had:\n\n-Chicken liver pâté, spiced plum chutney with sourdough toast - not sure if I really loved this one but the sourdough toast was good\nGlenbeigh mussels steamed in white wine, cream, celery and herbs with crusty baguette  - I don't normally like anything with celery but I didn't taste it here, so it was fine. I liked the mussels. This kind was small, which I prefer to the giant ones found in the U.S.\n-Pan roast Ballycotton monkfish, garlic ratte potatoes, roast pepper purée, lemon salted green beans, smoked pancetta and almond crumb - the fish was cooked perfectly and tasted fresh, but the green beans could have used a bit more cooking time\n-Sirloin Steak (10oz) - my husband got this one since he wanted to try the beef in Ireland, and it didn't disappoint. Their steaks are served with mushrooms, house chips, shallots and choice of: peppercorn and brandy cream, whipped garlic butter or roasted pepper chimichurri. He picked the peppercorn and brandy, which was nice\n\nI really liked that they had a kids' menu and that there were no chicken tenders or pizza to be found on there. Instead, there were dishes like shepherd's pie, pasta Bolognese, and roasted chicken breast. They even had a baby bowl, which we ended up ordering for my 8-month old. It was a huge bowl of mashed potatoes, finely shredded chicken, with tiny bits of soft carrots. She loved it! It also came with a side of gravy, but we used that for ourselves. It tasted similar to the peppercorn and brandy cream that came with the steak.

There were four of us, and we ordered a variety of dishes to get a good sense of what the menu had to offer.\n\nWe started with the Goat's Cheese Mousse Salad, Pâté, Arancini Balls, and Chicken Salad. All were incredibly plain, overpriced, and lacked any real flavour. For starters, these dishes could have been served at any budget restaurant, but here they were marked up far beyond what they were worth.\n\nFor the main course, we went with the Duck (€40), Lamb (€40), and Dover Sole. The Duck was dry, bland, and came with just a few baby carrots and flavorless potatoes. The Lamb was overcooked and equally tasteless. The Dover Sole was completely dry and lacked any seasoning or richness.\n\nWhat really left us feeling deceived, however, was the price. We would have been disappointed with the food even at a lower price point, but when you’re paying €100 per person, it’s simply not acceptable. To make matters worse, the service was lacking—staff didn’t even bother to serve our wine, and our Calypso Coffee arrived cold.\n\nThe only redeeming feature of the evening was the Margarita cocktail, which was actually quite nice.\n\nWe will definitely not be returning.

I felt out of place. My server, Jelmer , let me know that the typical thing to do was to get one of each course and it included drinks and desserts etc etc. and it was going to cost far more than I was looking to spend.\nHere I was just looking for a plate of chips and veg.\nI felt like I was taking up a spot for someone willing to pay the expected amount. I nearly left there and then, apologising that I misunderstood what the restaurant was and worrying I was making a fool of myself.\n\nHowever, any fears I had were quickly relieved when I explained myself to Jelmer. He alleviated my worries and worked with me through the menu and how to best take care of me. He assured me that I was just as much a priority as anyone else. I have a plant based diet and he didn't skip a beat. Without a worry or hesitation, he helped me through the menu and what I wanted.\n\nA few minutes later, after some nice, soft bread with delicious dips, I was enjoying the FINEST vegetables and chips I had ever had. And very nice portions, too!\n\nThe service from not just Jelmer, but all the staff like Davar, made me feel more at ease, relaxed.\nI was smiling the whole time I dined there. What better experience can you ask for?\nI don't know what they do to get such great staff, but they are a credit to the Manor.\nI had never heard of this place before, but now it's where I will recommend anyone looking to spend a night in Cork if they want a classy, friendly and relaxed experience.\n\nI didn't even spend €17, and I am stuffed.\n\nThanks Jelmar, and all of his wonderful co-workers.

I switched the mash the steak came with for the Colcannon, a local dish that is mash mixed with fresh cabbage, at the servers recommendation.

After several minutes passed, our server came to check and I explained that I had just asked to confirm I had gotten the right side. Side said I confused her when I said special. 😐  They finally redelivered my meal, after several more minutes, while my husband waited for me, and the potatoes were stone cold.  Alessia checked back and I told her the potatoes were very cold,  and she said they are supposed to be warm and not hot.  What?! This was pretty frustrating considering the food runner wasn't even sure what she was bringing to the table when I asked a simple question, and now I'm being told these ice cold potatoes are supposed to be like this?!  This was so awkward,  and I was ready to just leave. She returned shortly with steaming hot potatoes, which tasted pretty good.

The Room\nWe booked a 4-bed room — the beds were quite old, and the room itself was extremely small. For four people, it was definitely not suitable. We could barely move around without bumping into each other. Every time someone needed to go to the bathroom, the rest of us had to move. We felt more like homeless people than tourists visiting a city.\n\n2. Lounge with TV\nPoorly maintained, and due to the furniture, it looked very old and messy. I wouldn’t even call it a lounge — I’d rather stay in the tiny room than relax in that space.\n\n3. Kitchen\nThere’s a kitchen next to the lounge. It includes ovens, a stove, fridges, and a microwave so you can cook your own meals. However, due to how everything looked and was arranged, it felt very uninviting. I’d honestly rather pay €20 at a restaurant than cook in a kitchen that isn’t well-maintained.\n\n4. “Dining Area”\nWe expected a proper room where all guests could sit and eat. Instead, we ended up eating in a small space on high tables you usually see in bars. It felt more like we came for drinks than for breakfast.\nIf you want a good breakfast, I recommend going out instead. If you choose to eat at the hostel, you can only expect small spreads, toast, cereal, and coffee/juice. To be clear, it wasn’t a proper meal and we didn’t feel full afterwards.\n\nAll in all, after our stay we realized that we only paid for the location — not for a comfortable room, a nice dining space, or a proper chill-out area.\n\nThe only positive thing was that the staff were polite and explained all the rules clearly.\n\nIf comfort and a pleasant stay aren’t important to you, then I’d recommend this hostel just as a place to sleep. But for those who are looking for a realistic price for realistic services — meaning, you get what you pay for — I strongly suggest going somewhere else.\n\nIf you're planning to head to Dublin after Cork, I highly recommend the Clink Hostel — a big step up in every way."", ""sentiment"": ""Mixed""}, {""username"": ""Tanja Žanić"", ""user_id"": null, ""rating"": null, ""date"": null, ""review_text"": ""If you're only looking for a place to crash and don’t care much about comfort, this hostel might do the job.

Shared areas like the lounge and kitchen were outdated and not well maintained. The dining area was small and uninviting — breakfast was minimal and not filling at all.\n\nThe only upside was the polite and helpful staff."", ""sentiment"": ""Mixed""}, {""username"": ""Mariella Wilcke"", ""user_id"": null, ""rating"": null, ""date"": null, ""review_text"": ""Clean, hot, loud\n\nEdit after 2 nights: room unbearably hot, loud self-closing doors banging all night, so wouldn't recommend.\n\nFunctional and clean, fine for a couple of nights if you just need a place to sleep, not a place to spend any daytime in.\nCommunal areas are clean. Kitchen is ok for cooking only. Has no window.\nThe \""TV lounge\"" is not the cozy place you might imagine. It's a clean windowless space with a wall-mounted TV and several bar stools.\n4-bed-dorms are tiny, dark, clean, functional. Very loud ventilation shaft right outside window, loud even with window closed. Still, it's OK for sleeping so long as you use earplugs. Each bed has its own lamp but no curtains.\nBeds are strangely short, even for me - I'm1.63m - and not too comfortable. Matresses should really really be replaced.\nStaff are friendly.\n\nUnfortunately, I have to take one star off my initial 3 star review. Room was incredibly hot with heating on full throttle all night. Every time I turned the radiator down, one person in my room would turn it on full again.\nWhy's the heating on all night anyway in late april?\nHeating in bathroom couldn't be turned off at all.\nI spoke to two different members of staff about this, both seemed to be very understanding and promised to turn the heating's timer off for the next night. Neither of them did.\n\nOther guests were very inconsiderate - even for a hostel. There is no need to bang the doors all night (they're self-closing doors, so this is, at least in part, the hostel's fault), nor to pee standing up every single time you use the shared, mixed bathroom, and make a big mess.\n\nI stayin hostels frequently when travelling, and I use earplugs, so I'm usually alright for sleep. In this hostel, I could barely sleep 3 hours due to overheating and banging doors all night.\nOf course, the hostel doesn't encourage this kind of behaviour, but it is the way it is, and they don't do anything to stop it."", ""sentiment"": ""Mixed""}]"

A great sign for a place right?\n\nFirst, the food. The menu is very interesting with an excellent selection. I had pickled muscles for start, and the rump for main. The pickled muscles were tasty, but somewhat lacking the actual flavour of being pickled. The Rump was a touch overdone and not served with a side which was surprising. My wife had fried oysters to start, and steak tartar for main.\n\nI see in other comments that the owner has defended the cost while talking about challenging prices in the business. I would see this as fair, however, it would stand to reason that serving a steak in sauce and nothing else with it is a somewhat sad looking plate. If other business are managing a little something on the side, it may be worth taking a look at how the dish is presented here.\n\nThe atmosphere was busy, however downside of this was that it would be easier to hold a conversation next to a screaming toddler than here due to the mighty background noise.

Great intention, artistry, balance.

I'm not blaming them, but it definitely impacted our experience. As we were eating, there was a queue forming by us of people coming in the front door. And we're on a small two-person table that genuinely feels like it's going to get knocked over by the throng of people. The location isn't built / designed for both people sitting down, at least how it's laid out, and a large queue.\n\nWe were looking around to pay for a few minutes near the end of the meal and all the staff seemed preoccupied, so I asked the gentleman who had served us if I should pay at the counter, and he said yes. So I queued behind people coming in for takeaway coffees for a few minutes after the service had been to the table up to that point. I found this kind of messy, to be queuing twice for the same meal.\n\nThe kicker as to why we're unfortunately not enthusiastic to go back, a lady came in with a dog under her arm whose butt was looming-cum-hovering over my wife's food. This seems to be okay with the management, as she was seated and all, but the mix of flying dog and artisan eggs is not a good breakfast vibe.\n\nAmazing food, real nice staff, but too stressy and weirdly laid out to be a relaxing experience for us.
