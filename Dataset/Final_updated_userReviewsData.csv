"The Garden Cafe",1,"Rich Dietz",2119,"a year ago",5,"Amazing location and atmosphere.  Food was great and felt like you were away from the city.  Highly recommend."
"The Oval",2,"Thomas Thornton",2487,"2 years ago",5,"The Oval is another one of Cork's iconic pubs and its one of the cozy ones!
Located on the corner of S Main St and Tucky St., its a pub with a unique Oval shaped ceiling in Cork City center!
The pub has a wonderful ambienceve and the crowd that frequents the bar also gives it a certain charm!

The Staff:
The staff are friendly and welcoming as soon as you walk in the door!
They are very attentive and will serve you quickly!

Drink Selection:
They have a great selection of beer on tap and they serve all three major stouts!
Of which I chose a pint of their delicious Guinness draft!
A lot of people were ordering the Murphy's and Beamish aswell so I can only imagine that they are also good aswell!

Layout:
The layout of the bar is kind of split into two rooms. The first room has the feature for which it owes its namesake, the Oval shaped ceiling.
The second room has more seating and is to the rear of the premises. The bar is located in this room along with some seats.
The second room is smaller and is located towards the back. The main seating area is in this room and the stairs to the toilet is also here.
The bar has access to the seating area on Tucky St. which offers access to people who use wheelchairs.

Decor:
The pub is decorated with a lot of wood and with little quirky details and morabilia as well as little plaques with historic details, etc.

Overall Ipinion:
The Oval is an old bar in the City Center where time moves a little slower. They have a great selection of beers to choose from and I highly recommend stopping by for a beautiful pint of Guinness or drink of your choosing and have a chat with friends!"
"Badger & Dodo Roastery Outlet",3,"Zoe Serodio",2659,"6 days ago",5,"We did a Barista course with Aaron, and it was definitely worth the value! The small group classes allowed us to actually learn and practice as much as we wanted, which we truly appreciated. We‚Äôll definitely recommend it to someone interested in the coffee industry and looking to get started somewhere :)"
"Badger & Dodo Roastery Outlet",3,"Kalinda Link",1340,"a year ago",5,"We were getting our laundry done at the Laundry Basket across the street. Popped in here for a coffee and was the espresso ever fabulous! The next day when we came back to pick up our laundry the barista took the time to warm up my ceramic mug since we were staying in. Absolutely wonderful! Highly recommend!"
"Badger & Dodo Roastery Outlet",3,"Kevin Byrne",1413,"5 years ago",4,"Very few places in Cork where you can genuinely purchase quality coffee. There are a handful of good producers and roasters in Cork.  This is definitely one of the best if you don't want the acrid tastes all too common amongst Cork cafes.  This cafe forces the others to up their game."
"Badger & Dodo Roastery Outlet",3,"kieran Kenneally",1438,"2 years ago",4,"Nice small coffee shop with a small but cosy sitting area. Good music playing in the background, toilets are clean and the service and Coffee are excellent.
Coffee such a dark creamy colour before I put in some milk. You just know it's good before you even taste it."
"Badger & Dodo Roastery Outlet",3,"Apriry Ly",267,"4 months ago",5,"Badger & Dodo Coffee Roasters, Cork: Absolutely Amazing Coffee!

If you're serious about your coffee, then Badger & Dodo Coffee Roasters in Cork is the one to get your fix with these folks who are passionate about their craft, and it truly shines through in every cup.

The coffee here is simply **amazing**. Whether you're after a perfectly pulled espresso, a silky-smooth flat white, or a beautifully balanced filter coffee, they consistently deliver. The beans are expertly roasted, resulting in rich, complex flavors that are a real treat for the palate. It's clear they source high-quality beans and treat them with the respect they deserve.

Beyond the fantastic coffee, we tried them when they popped up at the Midleton farmers market. Highly, highly recommended for anyone seeking a truly exceptional coffee experience in Cork!"
"Badger & Dodo Roastery Outlet",3,"tomas allen",2518,"a year ago",4,"Just went in for coffee. The staff member was friendly and courteous. Nice coffee. Sat outside to drink it. Price of  a latte  @ ‚Ç¨3.90 but not a bad size cup . Nice place to call again. Didn't get any food there."
"Badger & Dodo Roastery Outlet",3,"CillianmfingHannon",516,"8 months ago",5,"Really nice coffee here, some of the best in the city!

"Badger & Dodo Roastery Outlet",3,"Michela Lagorio",1774,"6 months ago",5,"I always stop here for my morning coffee when I have time as it's delicious. The staff is always super friendly as well. Thank you !"
"Badger & Dodo Roastery Outlet",3,"Saoirs A",2238,"2 years ago",4,"I really love their coffee. Always delicious, always a friendly service. And I love to support a local business, however I‚Äôm dropping a star because today it cost me ‚Ç¨4.40 for an oat milk cappuccino, that‚Äôs ‚Ç¨1 more than a lot of other places in Cork. I just can‚Äôt afford to spend that much on a coffee. I will go here again as a treat but in general I can get delicious coffee elsewhere for cheaper. Other than that I couldn‚Äôt fault the place."
"The Floury Apron",4,"Michael Outlaw",1764,"3 months ago",5,"I have been trying for years to find a bakery in Cork that could prepare a southern-style caramel cake, a flavour of cake my wife loves because it reminds her of her childhood in the US. Most bakeries I contacted turned me down immediately because it would mean trying an unfamiliar recipe. At The Floury Apron, they not only took on my custom order, but stayed in contact with me for the couple weeks leading up to my wife's birthday while they tried out the first-time recipe and then asking what finishing touches I wanted in terms of decoration. The cake was exactly what we wanted, gorgeously decorated and tasted amazing! We were just blown away by the personal effort made by The Floury Apron to make this happen for us. Will 100% be coming back to them for any future cake orders!"
"The Floury Apron",4,"Tony Mc Keon",2528,"a month ago",5,"We recently ordered a sandwich platter for 15 people from the Floury Apron. They were absolutely top quality and we had a great mix of fillings in ciabatta , foccacia, wraps and slice pan.

Caroline was very attentive via email and followed up afterwards to make sure we were happy with our order. Food, service and value were all 10/10. Would highly recommended."
"Amicus",345,"Glauco Vendrame",974,"a year ago",5,"Good place to enjoy a dinner or lunch with someone you love.

I went with my wife to celebrate our day and we were very well served, the waiters thought about the details, always leaving the table clean."
"The Laurel Bar",6,"Cian O' Flynn",500,"a month ago",1,"Really really disappointing place in general. The interior was quite dingy and stuffy. The place looks quite careless thrown together with random stuff on the walls and a pool table that it is not in use.
A group and I tried to watch an Irish soccer game there one night. The commentary was 5 seconds behind the visuals and one of the screens was glitching. The women insisted everyone at our table bought something when actually 4 out of 5 of us bought something. She was quite rude, blunt and ill mannered. It really made us feel uncomfortable, unwanted and unappreciated. Out of the 100s of great pubs in Cork, this is definitely one of the to avoid."
"The Laurel Bar",6,"Pat O'Sullivan",1988,"2 months ago",1,"Though I've never been a customer of this bar.  The auld one who runs the bar needs to realise that the bar does not own the parking space outside the bar and by placing kegs outside the premises, does not mean that the general public cannot park there.  The woman who works there shouting abuse at me last week which was totally uncalled for."
"The Laurel Bar",6,"Stephen Kulik",2393,"Edited 3 years ago",5,"Best bar in cork!family run business and the staff and owners are literally the nicest people you could actually meet,Joe and Regina are just the best and they will literally treat you like your thier actual family, such lovely people and proper cork people supporting the community, A must visit if your in Cork City  Centre"

Food was fresh, hot and tasted great! Highly recommended!"
"Tara's Tea Rooms",8,"I Ta",1062,"a month ago",5,"I'm dying of jealousy writing this comment because this cafe has become my favorite place. The food, the tea, the coffee, the beer, the service are 10/10000. Everything here is inexplicable, it's out of this world. Everything here is good, everything here is wonderful. I went here every day in a row in Cork. The Apple Spice tea is wonderful. Please try it. Everything is made here from the heart. I love this place. My friend and I call it Grandma's house because it evokes warmth and good things! I love it here!"

"Tara's Tea Rooms",8,"Jenn A",1191,"a month ago",5,"So cute! I was actually a bit ill the morning we went so I was relieved they had just toast as an option for this menu - my friend had eggs with spinach and we both enjoyed the food and atmosphere. It was petty busy that morning so service was on the slower side. If we were in Cork for longer we'd definitely come back!"

"Rearden's Bar",10,"Alexey Tretyakov",131,"3 years ago",5,"Good price for traditional Irish breakfast 10,95‚Ç¨ (18‚Ç¨ in Dublin for example), and expensive tea (like everywhere) for 4,50 but you have 3 cups of tea in fact, totally worth it. Friendly staff (double salary for Christophe! üòé), in morning nice seats with opened window. Soup of the the day is just amazing if you are not very hungry. ‚Ä¶"
"Rearden's Bar",10,"G Ryan",910,"3 months ago",3,"Went when there was a jukebox band on, was a good vibe but drinks were a joke. Paid 24‚Ç¨ for a jack and coke and a vodka cran, got the same thing in another bar plus 2 shots for 19‚Ç¨, been a few times but would definitely have pre - drinks before going in, the people inside are a mix of mams and creeps, luck of the draw. Bartender ignored us 4 times before serving us. Also very little crowd control in there, it's like a tin of sardines"

"Priory Coffee Co.",12,"Nate ON8 Productions",1858,"Edited 7 years ago",5,"Hey Priory its me.üòÜüòÜüòÜ anyone who knows me knows that i treasure the yellow chairs and the atmosphere of the Priory. My first encounter with the Priory was in Youghal. When I learned tat they were opening up shop 8minutes away from where i live, I was very excited. We have gotten to know one another on Instagram and with my regular caffine refueling afternoons. I have attended their coffee cupping as well. Out of all the things that they do; i admire how they do their utmost to support the local community."
"Priory Coffee Co.",12,"Rens De Groot",2111,"3 years ago",3,"The staff is always super nice, always up for a chat. Coffee always used to be great, we used to go here a lot. Lately we noticed that the quality of the coffee has been going down. I feel like there's a lot of new staff, and the quality of the cappuccinos has been going down. Foam is lacking, and cappuccinos are too hot, which makes us choose different coffee places over Priory lately."
"Priory Coffee Co.",12,"Soundy Sound",2369,"a month ago",2,"Only takeaway cups despite having seating inside and outside.
That's enough to put me off but the quality of the coffee has declined too."

Disappointed in food selection as they were out of a lot of the fresh items, but did have plenty of ready made sandwiches.

"The Roundy",14,"John Mee",1263,"2 months ago",5,"Very nice bar and the staff were very friendly, as you'd expect from Cork people.
Sit outside - it's great for people watching. There's a good mix of ages and nationalities there too.
Bring a jacket with you because it can get a little chilly if there's a breeze - or maybe that's just the age I'm at!
But let's not talk about my age here - just know that it's a sensitive subject. :-)"
"The Roundy",14,"Grant Oakes",993,"7 months ago",4,"Really nice pub, could spend a few hours there and have a nice time.

Didn't have food and was there for a comedy show."
"The Roundy",14,"Sean o donovan",2296,"3 months ago",1,"The absolutely undeserved level of disrespect and belittlement I was shown today in the ‚Äú Roundy bar‚Äù in cork city is an absolute disgrace. My girlfriend and I were in town today around lunch time and we decided to go to the ‚ÄúRoundy bar‚Äù to sit down and watch the world go by. As neither me or my girlfriend  wanted to drink alcohol she got us two waters and sat outside. At this time we were not made aware by any staff or signs that you need to spend money in order to sit in the bars seats outside. While we were chatting and minding our own business, a lady who seemed to be somewhat in charge but not a manager came out to us and asked us, had we purchased anything from the bar. We informed her we got two waters but she re-asked had we bought anything and we said no. She didn‚Äôt even bother to inform/ ask us could we buy something and spend money in order to sit down ( which we would have no problem with). Instead she began to belittle us and treat us as if we were dirt on her shoe while laughing that we can‚Äôt sit here as we spent no money. This lady then returned inside and we decided to continue drinking the two glasses of water which we were served inside the same bar without a problem. The lady came back out  and asked us ‚Äúare we moving on yet ‚Äúto which I replied ‚Äúwhat did we do wrong‚Äù . He also informed her that we only occupied 1 table and there were only 3 other occupied tables outside and the bar which was quiet AND EMPTY.All we wanted was to sit down and watch the world go but we were wrong for only getting water ? The lady had little to no response and then snatched what was remaining of my girlfriends glass of water and went inside, also after asking for her name she laughed into my girlfriends face saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to tell you that girl‚Äù. In shock and embarrassment of how we were treated, we left immediately. I am absolutely disgusted by how we were made feel and how this could have been easily avoided by simply informing us rather than being condescending. I‚Äôm posting this to raise awareness of their level of customer service and we will be making a formal complaint to the manager."
"The Roundy",14,"Thomas O' Neill",2483,"a month ago",1,"Guinness was awful. The staff seemed friendly but when questioned about the quality they became very defensive. Worst Guinness I have had in Cork. I will not go back in the door of the Roundy based on unfriendly staff reaction.

"Sober Lane",16,"Colin O'Brien",546,"4 months ago",1,"We waited over 40 minutes for a burger and some chicken wings, and the place wasn‚Äôt busy at all. No idea what took so long but would not recommend. Staff were nice but it was pretty annoying to look at them all just standing around when you‚Äôre left three quarters of an hour waiting on what you thought would be a quick bite.

The service rating isn‚Äôt a reflection on the floor staff, it‚Äôs just for the slow kitchen. Such a shame because it ruined what would otherwise have been an enjoyable experience."

Their poor choice of strobing Christmas lights combine with the screens to create a very flashy amusement arcade like atmosphere.

"The Idle Hour",18,"Kouros Zanbouri",1447,"2 years ago",5,"During my stroll through the charming Port of Cork, I stumbled upon a quaint Irish pub that beckoned me inside. Eager to experience a taste of the local culture, I decided to stop in for a refreshing drink. From the moment I entered, the barmaid (server) greeted me with genuine warmth, kindness, and a helpful attitude.

Taking note of my curiosity, she attentively listened to my preferences and offered a wonderful suggestion: Irish apple cider. It happened to be my first time trying cider, and I'm delighted to say it was a delightful choice. The cider was perfectly crafted, striking a harmonious balance between sweetness and crispness that left me longing for another sip.

The pub itself exuded a friendly and inviting atmosphere. Although the bustling bar area was occupied, the cozy coaches offered a serene spot for me to unwind and savor my drink. Immersed in the authentic Irish ambiance, I couldn't help but appreciate the genuine sense of camaraderie and enjoyment that permeated the air.

This impromptu visit to the Irish pub left a lasting impression on me. The attentive and amiable service provided by the barmaid, along with the exceptional Irish apple cider, contributed to a truly memorable experience. I relished every moment, immersing myself in the rich tapestry of Irish tradition and hospitality.

If you find yourself exploring the Port of Cork, I wholeheartedly recommend paying a visit to this charming pub. Whether you're a cider aficionado or simply seeking a genuine taste of Ireland, you'll be treated to a warm welcome, an inviting atmosphere, and a drink that will transport you to good places."
"The Idle Hour",18,"Kevin Byrne",1413,"a year ago",3,"The atmosphere was quite non existent.  If it wasn't for our group, there'd have been a handful of elderly patrons in the bar. The best thing about the bar was in my opinion the service. We were served by a really nice girl who was polite and helpful to our group. The clientele was 100% male on the Saturday night we were there which I found rather unusual. Fine for a pint in the afternoon."
"The Idle Hour",18,"Cillian",515,"a year ago",5,"Slow service but otherwise a lovely pub with so much character.

A great place to watch games, it has a load of tellies and there are always some people there watching so there is a bit of atmosphere.

Maybe a bit rough around the edges and a little out of the way but it has a charm about it and is worth the trip.

Service is shockingly slow though."

"Thompsons Cork",19,"Chlo√© Morineau",467,"3 weeks ago",4,"The meal was delicious. We took the wagyu burger which was very tasty and surprising with the creamy sauce and the chicken one for the same reason, very tasty. The seafood linguine was very tasty though not enough in the plate and the chicken Supreme was good. The desserts were also amazing. The only thing I'd have to say is that we asked for tap water and got a bottled water instead, we informed one of the waitress mid dinner, and though the waitress told us she'd take it off our bill we still paid for it"

"Thompsons Cork",19,"Rob S",2135,"2 weeks ago",5,"The staff at the Residence Inn recommended Thompsons to us and we could not hav been happier.  Hands down the most luxurious meal we had in Ireland.

First things first - this is not and inexpensive restaurant.  You are paying top shelf prices for top shelf food.  Having said that, if you are an American make sure you account for the fact that you are not going to be expected to add 30% as a tip.  We live in the DC area and the prices were comparable for us.  IF you know DC, think Old Ebbits Grill for price and overall feel.

This is a steak place.  I recommend getting the steak.  That said, SO got the salmon and it was excellent.  You can see from the pictures my steak was perfectly cooked.  Deserts were just as perfect.  I got the pear with sorbet and added the Pear Shaped cocktail.  I have a dairy allergy and I was over the moon that they had a dairy free desert.

Staff was excellent and so was the atmosphere.

Despite being a truly upscale dining experience we did not feel out of place in travel clothing.  I think the stress on dress codes has relaxed all over but I was slightly concerned we would be under dressed for such a nice place.  No concerns at all.

Just a great dining experience in a great location an easy walk from our hotel.  Doesnt get much better."
"Thompsons Cork",19,"Shelley R",2326,"a month ago",4,"Quaint old style decor. Central location in Cork, up from the railway station and near enough to the bus station, recommend to anyone on a short visit. Recommend for locals too üòâ.
This review is from our June 2025 visit, and we will definitely return to enjoy another evening.

A busy restaurant with 2 evening sitting times, bookings recommended for evening times.

Supports local and environmentally friendly, with food and alcohol from local suppliers (farm to fork steaks).

Varied menu. Tasty food."
"Thompsons Cork",19,"Rosana Pinheiro-Machado",2179,"3 months ago",3,"I wanted to treat myself with a dry age special cut, which was very expensive but the description was promising. A 30 day dry aged meat has a very peculiar taste but it come covered with garlic. I was very clear that I wanted a plain steak, with no garnish, only with salt and paper. As it happens with all things cooked with garlic, the garlic was so prominent that could only taste it!!!. if I had chosen any cheaper beef the taste would have been the same! While this primary mistake could be okay (it happens after all), the problem came when I told the manager that the chef should avoid that. The manager said that it was impossible, that there was no garlic in the kitchen, insisting I was wrong (and therefore crazy!). This was so disappointing. Instead of accepting what I said, the manager decided to gaslight me. I also ordered a very rare meat and they brought it medium-medium rare. I spent lots of money in a very amateur meal. On a positive note, the atmosphere was super nice and the guy who served me was very friendly too. The steak was not bad, but it is not worth the price for the special cut."
"The River Club",25,"Emma White",820,"a week ago",5,"We came here for afternoon tea to celebrate my sisters 30th birthday, we discovered that the waiter George had the same birthday!

We were warmly welcomed by the staff, who were not only friendly and attentive but also went the extra mile by singing happy birthday for my son ‚Äî a really thoughtful touch.

Most of us went for the steak, and I had the 8oz fillet with chunky chips, baby potatoes, and French beans ‚Äî everything was cooked to perfection. The restaurant is also very accessible, with great facilities and a prime location on MacCurtain Street.

The steak was under-seasoned and a little chewy, cooked less than the medium rare I ordered and with minimal sear. I think the chips were re-heated  (inexpertly), so lacked crunch.

"The River Club",25,"Kate Hoare",1372,"6 months ago",5,"I can't remember our servers name, but he was so nice and helpful. His name might have started with a G? We were booked for afternoon tea for 3pm for my friends belated birthday. Our server was very attentive, remembered I mentioned we were meeting for my friends bday and brought out a bday plate for my friend. We got a mocktail on arrival and honey pot when leaving. These touches are so nice, and I'll be recommending the venue to friends and family. I'll be back soon, such a relaxing and nice spot. All the staff were very attentive from the girl at the desk to the server. You don't get good customer service like this anymore so it was so refreshing."
"The River Club",25,"Jinal Sarvaiya",1229,"a year ago",5,"Amazing dining experience for my bestie‚Äôs birthday!!!!!! The meal itself was fantastic and the service was exceptional. I highly recommend the terrace for its relaxing and pleasant ambiance.

Decorated with signature floral arrangements, it provides a breathtaking view of the River Lee, making it perfect for an enjoyable dinner. Additionally, we received a complimentary dessert for the birthday girl, which was a very kind gesture. ü´∂üèª

I strongly recommend this wonderful place for its exceptional food and outstanding service. The waitstaff are attentive and clearly dedicated to providing excellent care to their customers.

"Burritos & Blues",26,"PH",2038,"2 months ago",5,"Only place in town that still gives massive meat portions in 2025!!! They are literally the only place that is not stingy on the meat. I used to go to places like boojum and zambreros but burritos and blues has become my go to now that their prices are not outrageous! You can even do half and half and mix meat types! Its really so much better than anywhere else for the price. They know what they are doing, and I am now a loyal customer! Really good for students too."
"Burritos & Blues",26,"Paul Richard Bungay",2018,"a year ago",5,"If you are looking for an affordable Mexican experience, this is the place to go. They use fresh ingredients and prepare your food when you order it. Best value for money. Excellent customer service as well. You can customize your order and as usual I have provided their menu on the pictures. You can dine in and do take away whatever suits you but I recommend eating there as food is prepared fresh. I always order their burritos, nachos, and quesadillas. I always eat here when I‚Äôm craving for nachos. It is definitely worth the visit :)"
"Burritos & Blues",26,"Narashima P",1847,"6 months ago",5,"This is my goto place after a long stroll around the city. It's pocket friendly, has clean and fresh ingredients,  you can pick the items which makes it versatile. The nacho, burritos, cubes and all the toppings are extremely tasty. Try their jalape√±o Verde sauce as its unique and flavourful. I would always go here and recommend everyone.
Cheers."
"Burritos & Blues",26,"Marinac Marinac",1638,"a month ago",1,"Have a very bad experience after ordering a chicken burrito from this place through Deliveroo on the 20.8  around noon. Within a few hours, I started feeling extremely bloated and unwell, and soon after I developed severe diarrhea that has continued for two days now. I have been feeling very weak and unable to eat properly two days in a row now.

I noticed that another customer mentioned that they and three of their friends also suffered food poisoning here, which makes me strongly believe that this was the source of my illness as well.

This has been one of the worst food-related experiences I‚Äôve ever had, and I would advise others to be very cautious. I'm burritos and blues customer for the 10 years."

Amazing environment with lovely food and drink offered. The oyster is fresh, served with lemon sorbet, which is interesting. Their cocktail menu is very innovative but also tasty. We went in and had a lovely afternoon. There was a live band there too."
"The Oyster Tavern",28,"Sadhbh Zilla",2218,"3 years ago",5,"This was my first time in the Oyster since it was renovated and it's absolutely gorgeous. The lounge downstairs is plush but laid back and the upstairs bar and dining area has a New Cork cocktail bar feel.
The food was delicious and reasonably priced (18 for a large cheese/meat plate I couldn't come close to finishing) and came out fast. The staff were great and very responsive, and there's also an excellent choice of drinks.
You can sit at the bar in plush seats, so a nice option for dates, and the tables can handle larger groups too.
There's a lift upstairs so it's accessible, although the loo doors may be tricky for some wheelchairs.
We had a great night and I'll be back next time I fancy treating myself a little."
"The Oyster Tavern",28,"Taylor Moch",2454,"2 years ago",5,"Excellent quiet location tucked away in central Cork near the English Market.

"The Oyster Tavern",28,"Fiona Tobin",883,"5 years ago",3,"It was good, broken seat, and even though it was a brunch at 2pm there was no dessert menu. We would have stayed and had a lot more to drink if there was some kind of dessert menu for that time, food we got was lovely.

"The Oyster Tavern",28,"Marina",1636,"3 years ago",5,"Very good and high quality food.
bad service.
the waiter doesn't have fault (very kind and professional) the problem is: there is no communication between the kitchen and the dining room's waiters.
the kitchen must communicate and update the waiter for every order.
if some food or ingredients are not there or it is finish, this is the first information that the waiter must tell to the customer....because if the customer orders and the food is finished, you disappoint the customer's expectations."
"The Oyster Tavern",28,"Kanika Singh",1343,"4 years ago",5,"Amazing Tapas style food . They have some arepas, classic bar food like chicken wings, scampi, fish and chips etc.

You'd think for how great the atmosphere is, how wonderful the staff are, how tasty and fresh the food is, that this place would be more expensive - but no!
Incredible vegan and vegetarian Italian food, sustainable ethos, and the best vibes.
Genuinely though, I can't overstate how amazing this food is. But pleaseeeee book in advance. You are NEVER going to be able to walk in and get a table because the food is too good
Please bury me with the sweet garlic bread"

"KC & Son & Sons",335,"Thomas Thornton",2487,"Edited 2 years ago",5,"KC & Son & Sons is a Cork staple! It is definitely worth the drive to Douglas to go stand in the queue down the street from their door way! Their pittas are really worth it!

Staff:
The staff are very friendly here. They are also very attentive and get the order right everytime no matter how big your order is.

Food:
They have so many choices to choose from here with their Pittas being the main items that they are known for!
Some of their best pittas in my own opinion are the King Creole (Chicken), the Philly Steak (Beef) and my personal favourites the Angry Spaniard (Chicken & Chorizo) and the Kansas City Pitta (Pork).
The Angry Spaniard is a hot Pitta filled Chips, Mayo, Lettuce and topped off with Chorizo, Chicken and hot sauce!
Then the Kansas City Pitta is a hot Pitta filled with Chips, Mayo, Lettuce, sliced gherkin and topped off with slow roasted pork belly that is rubbed with their own blend of spices and coated in a homemade BBQ sauce!
Whats not to love!
They also serve really tasty burgers and they have the world of side options. These range from chips to Pineapple Fritters to their famous Chicken Bombays.
They have these huge bags too if you order a lot of food or if you need to carry your option in one bag. Handy to bring it on a picnic.

Queue:
Don't be phased by the queue here as sometimes it could be 10 people long and just inside the premises or 30 people deep outsode of the premises!
It does move fast and you won't be waiting any longer than 30 minutes to get inside to make your order.

Layout:
The new layout is much more efficient and it goes as follows: You walk up one side of the queuing area inside the premesis and at the top of this side you place your order, then turn at the top and you walk back down the other side towards the doorway and they will have your order prepaired and ready for collection juat as you go out the door!

Overall Recommendation:
I highly recommend calling to KC & Son & Sons as its a Cork staple! I always find myself here every couple of weeks and I nearly always find myself going for something different to what I ordered last time!"
"Sonflour",30,"L W",1462,"4 months ago",3,"Food is absolutely amazing. However the experience let us down‚Ä¶
We booked dinner on a Thursday night and we were there on time. But we were not made aware by the staff that we need to return the table in 2 hours. So the whole meal we felt really rushed by the staff. Ordered cocktails,starter, main and dessert. Starter plate came with water on it‚Ä¶ had to wipe it away with napkin; while we were having the starter, the staff already brought our main and apologized that their main was cooked too quickly - at that point, we already felt rushed by the staff. When eating main, staff checked if she could take our plates away once. But I didn‚Äôt finish my food and still have my fork in my hand‚Ä¶ later we were told we have to give the table back within 20min.. if we want to order dessert.. this is the first time we were made aware of the 2 hour rule and understood the why staff kept rushing us‚Ä¶  the staff served one of the dessert with chocolate stain on it ü´†ü´†ü´† disgusting ü´† no time to bother, we finished it very quickly and of course receipt came in super quickly without asking.. cuz staff is in a rush to get us out‚Ä¶(deleted the service fee part- thankfully we weren‚Äôt charged service fee for the service)

Food is amazing- but the experience was not nice.. if you could kindly made your customer aware of the 2 hour table rule before they order, I am sure every customer would understand and plan their order and time for eating accordingly‚Ä¶apologies if some of your customers do not read your online notice properly and expect your in-store staff to take a few seconds to give a reminder ‚Ä¶"

Kitchen's hours are strictly 5pm - 9:30pm 7 days a week with the exception of Saturday where it operates 3pm - 9:30pm. Staff were friendly and nice but the service was very slow when we would ask for something. Keep that in mind regarding the hours.

Spice Bag Loaded Fries we're pretty good, definitely very heavily spiced, and a large portion. Fish and Chips were also solid. The breading was much thinner than most other dishes I've had and the tartare sauce was more watery, more like regular mayo. Solid overall."

"Sonflour",30,"EmeraldCity VeganEats",807,"3 months ago",5,"On our second full day in Ireland, we ventured to the town of Cork, the 2nd largest city in the Republic of Ireland.  We had a lot of options to choose from in deciding where to eat as Cork has an absolute wealth of amazing vegan friendly places.  While it was difficult to choose, we opted for Sonflour, a completely vegetarian and mostly vegan Italian restaurant in the main shopping area about halfway between the North Channel and the South Channel of the River Lee.

We were blown away with our whole experience there.  The ambiance is just so far removed from that which we've encountered locally in the states, it was quaint, charming, rustic and all things in-between.  Italian food is one of those cuisines that can be challenging to find vegan options so we were intrigued with the idea of a whole restaurant dedicated to vegetarian/vegan food Italian fare.

For starters, we ordered what I believe to be Focaccia Bread but I forget the ,specific menu name.  Being a big fan of seaweed, I had to order their ""Better Call Saul..ad"" (get it? saul..ad .. salad ... lol :) ) ""A small fresh salad, made with local Seaweed, Rocket, Carrots, Cherry Tomatoes, Balsamic Vinegar, Seeds, Truffle oil and Vegan Mayonnaise.  Both were absolutely a divine treat on the palate, bursting with flavor, true story!

For our main dish, we both ordered Ravioli, Sandi having ordered the ""Vintage sauce - Our Slow Cooked Tomato Sauce made with Fresh Vegetables and Mediterranean, Herbs, Basil Leaves and Evoo"" and for me, the ""Sunflower‚Äôs soul sauce - Homemade Fresh Vegan Pesto, Baked Roasted Potatoes, Cherry Tomatoes and Evoo, Pine Nuts and Edible Flowers"".  Words cannot hope to do these dishes justice so I'll simply say, the dish melted in our mouths!

For dessert, we chose ""Affogato Italian coffee-based dessert. 2 scoops of Vegan Local Vanilla Ice Cream drowned with a shot of our hot Organic Espresso Giuliano"". You need simply look at the attached picture to know everything you need to know about how good this was.

We simply could not be happier with our choice of cuisine while in Cork.  While we would have loved if we had more time to try other options, Sonflour left an incredibly lasting impression."
"The Raven Bar",32,"Lourdes Vicente Rodr√≠guez",1551,"a year ago",4,"The Raven is definitely my bar to go when I like to enjoy a casual dinner with great drinks. My favourite bites are for sure the cauliflower wings, spicy and delicious üòã While you are there, I would also recommend trying their tacos, especially the falafel ones with Sriracha mayo. They also have a vegan board with miso mushrooms, spicy cauliflower bites, hummous, tofu, falafel, and olives. I recently had the croquettes, but they weren't good.

"Upstairs",34,"Anzhelika",253,"a year ago",5,"–êwwww, my favorite place for the soul.
You bring the right person, order a cocktail, and dive into deep, meaningful conversations ‚Äî that‚Äôs what this place means to me! The music and lighting inside are just perfect. All the cocktails are delicious, and I like ordering something random ‚Äî try it if you're unsure what to choose, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.
This place is unique and incredibly cozy, it definitely leaves a lasting impression. I only share it with special people :)"
"Upstairs",34,"Ivan Merc",1098,"3 months ago",5,"Excellent place for evening cocktails. Small speakeasy but the product is delicious. Cocktails are excellent made with passion and knowledge. Did enjoy Fine Pear and some other concoctions from the menu. Will be back. Thank you."
"Upstairs",34,"Daniel Munder",620,"7 months ago",5,"Upstairs will craft you an incredibly well-balanced cocktail.

"Upstairs",34,"George Kyritsis",945,"2 years ago",5,"This place has a unique and ultimately cozy atmosphere !  Like the ones you see in some of the Hollywood classics!  But this is not the only feature that will make you come back.  It is open late and if you can‚Äôt get served anywhere else after 11:30, it is the place to go to!  The staff is friendly and inviting and are experts in mixology!  I had one of the best espresso martinis ever!  The presentation was immaculate!  I was impressed by the bartenders David and Naiomb!  If bartending was an Olympic sport, they would win gold!  Just watching them work and prepare the drinks was like watching an artist create a masterpiece!  They obviously take great pride in their work!  I just hope their boss appreciates their work and talent!  Overall, an excellent and safe venue for a late cocktail!  A hidden gem in Cork City Centre just down the street from the post office!  You won‚Äôt find any other place like it! Perfect for a gathering of friends or a romantic rendezvous with your significant other with an atmosphere that will make your meeting a most delightful memory!"
"De Calf Cafe",37,"Rucha Ambilpure",2192,"3 months ago",4,"We tried Marinated Avacado and Vegan Avacado Toast. Both the dishes were good. The beans in Vegan Avacado Toast were nicely made with some Onion and Pepper in it. Avacado was also very fresh. Ambiance of place is good. They have good amount of sitting. The staff was also very friends and helpful."
"Upstairs",34,"David Markley",667,"2 years ago",5,"You rarely go wrong with a local recommendation and this was no exception. We directed here with the instructions to ‚ÄúWalk to the post office. Turn Left. Go upstairs to the bar with no storefront.‚Äù

The bar is called Upstairs, according to the menu, and it was a joy to find.

The woman at the bar made her own homemade limoncello that was divine! We caught her making the next batch and she gave us a sample. It was wonderful on its own and a great addition to ‚ÄúDown with this sort of Thing.‚Äù

We will be back, when we visit Cork again!"

Coffee was good."

"Dukes Coffee Company",35,"kieran Kenneally",1438,"a year ago",3,"Breakfast was quite big and the black pudding was really nice because I usually don't like it. First time in here.
‚Ç¨16.50 for breakfast is a lot, it's just too much. ‚Ç¨4 for a large Americano?
I didn't ask for large and I wasn't offered an alternative and also it just wasn't very large and mostly gone before breakfast was finished.
Look, there was plenty of food and I wasn't going to be hungry for a while after this but its just too much money! Could have got cheaper elsewhere (lots of places nearby) but I like to try new places.
I wouldn't pay that again."

Can't wait to go back"

"De Calf Cafe",37,"Mr Walsh",1829,"a year ago",4,"A great fry up breakfast not to be mistaken for a traditional full Irish breakfast as it has no beans. De Calf Cafe does their own tasty twist with a relish sauce and a very large mushroom. Served very quickly and nice and warm. The breakfast is ‚Ç¨14.50 just enough left from ‚Ç¨15 to leave a tip if you decide to. The price is expensive but that is expected as these are average prices nowadays. With restaurants and pubs closing every day due to rising costs and vat rates etc. The staff at Del Calf Cafe are very hard working and constantly busy keeping the place looking fantastic and clean. It is a great restaurant with plenty of space seating that offers privacy alongside intimacy. It has a great interior and is very cosy in a historic part of the city. Highly recommend as they have a great menu and selection of foods and drinks."
"De Calf Cafe",37,"NeptuneNebula",1869,"7 months ago",5,"The food was awesome, and honestly, they had the best mocha that I've had during my friend and I's trip throughout Ireland. Their french toast was also very good and a nice start to the day."

No hospitality! Just straight up yelled at us that they don‚Äôt have any bread when we asked for sandwich as if she didn‚Äôt want us there ! And was not patient enough to answer my doubts about the filling for the wrap .... gave us stale relish ! The carrot cake was bad ... Very dirty spoons ! Very unwelcoming! Never stepping here again !
As a food safety manager I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to eat here because the food tasted like it was plastic !
But the coffee was very served by the lovely barista ... who I hope is treated well by the management...."
"De Calf Cafe",37,"BCL ADRIAN",314,"Edited a year ago",5,"De Calf is a very nice restaurant to eat lunch or breakfast or even just have a coffee and cake. It is hidden inside TK Max shopping just off Corn Market in Cork City. They have options for vegitarians, vegans and non vegan. Their prices are quite good in comparison to other restaurants in Cork City. This is the perfect restaurant for a budget breakfast or lunch and/or tea and coffee. They provide good quality food also and the portions are generous. You don't leave there hungry at a very good price. The staff there are very nice. There are managers there both with blond hair but are so so nice they are extremely friendly and always welcoming. They provide top quality service and always have your requests at the heart of their service. Thank you guys. Still highly recommend here for lunch or breakfast."

On Saturdays I would wake up early in the morning just so I can get my fave cappucino and scone (with clotted cream!) at this cafe.

When we walked into the cafe it was quite busy which was a good sign. Latte nice and scone fine too. I would of preferred if the scone was warm when served and there was a bit of a baking powder taste to it but I enjoyed the scone though. Staff were jolly.

"Cornstore Cork",38,"Mark Mirigian",1659,"4 months ago",5,"Great place for a date night, with areas for semi-private booths away from the open seating areas. The French onion soup was flavorful but a little sweet. Steaks were cooked perfectly, tender and juicy. Some bolder red wines (like a Primitivo) would pair better with good steaks. The cookie and ice cream is worth another visit."
"Cornstore Cork",38,"Elizabeth Sayers-Birdee",794,"3 months ago",4,"We chose the set menu. Chicken liver parfait to start and then the ribeye steak, it's served with spinach and chips or mash. All delicious, my friend said it was the best steak he'd had in a long time. Service is also good, all in all definitely worth a visit whilst in Cork"
"Cornstore Cork",38,"Jemima Daisy",1187,"3 weeks ago",5,"Gorgeous steak - we shared the Tomahawk special (1kg). Dauphinaise potatos were a stand out - very cheesy! The blue cheese accompanying sauce was really lovely but the bone marrow butter was a little disappointing - tasted weirdly like shop bought garlic sauce?!
Tuna ceviche was missing a bit of the lime / citrus flavour I expected but was still enjoyable.

Baked Alaska and creme brulee were very tasty puddings. Wine list was decent.

Old fashioned cocktail was perfect!

Service was excellent and very attentive."
"Cornstore Cork",38,"Jake Higgins",1136,"5 months ago",4,"Decided to try on a busy Saturday night so atmosphere inside was good, service was quick and attentive.

Food was distinctly okay. Went for the steak but could not say it particularly stood out against other offerings elsewhere. Would give another try as rest of the menu has some good options."
"Cornstore Cork",38,"savannah flood",2272,"4 months ago",5,"We went here for our anniversary dinner, it was delicious we had a great experience. The cocktails were next level exquisite, i was driving and they accommodated my no alcohol request perfectly. All the cocktails are made to request as I was able to order any of the cocktails as mocktails. I ordered the pornstar martini and they even served me a shot of lemonade! My partner enjoyed normal cocktails and reported they were amazing. For dinner I ordered the sundries tomato cannelloni which wasn‚Äôt my favourite but still nice. My partner ordered the salmon which was cooked perfectly. We ordered a side of mashed potatoes which were creamy and delicious. Desert was equally delicious and the staff surprised us with a candle for our anniversary. Overall it was well worth the price."

My dining companion had 2 soft fried eggs with bacon, sausage, toast and tea which he demolished in no time. Very busy at 11am but turnaround seemed fast with tables emptying and filling very quickly coming up to lunch time. Menu looks good. Looking forward to trying it another time. Parking might be an issue as there are other businesses in the area. I was lucky enough to get one just across the road. Best trying off peak times I'd say.  There are a few outside tables also."

It was sad because we spent a long time waiting for our food, time wasted waiting and frustrating because we had hoped to have a good experience, especially with the service."

So disappointed as I work in the industrial estate and would have become a regular."
"Coffee Corner Cafe",40,"Yvonne C",2642,"Edited 2 years ago",2,"Was there recently. Slow service but maybe they were short staffed. Got a chicken tikka wrap and a cappuccino. Expensive for what it was. It would have been nice to get a bit of salad or a few crisps on the side. Won't be rushing back.

I also like a lot the cherry sponge cake!"
"Coffee Scape",43,"Lucas Raiol",1561,"2 months ago",5,"One the best caf√©s in Cork without a doubt!

Their lattes are extremely well-made and they have many options of different flavors. Also, they‚Äôre experts at making delicious sweets and desserts. I‚Äôd definitely recommend their pistachio tiramisu!

If you‚Äôre looking for something savory as well, they sandwiches are very tasty. Crunchy bread with high quality ingredients!"
"Coffee Scape",43,"R√≥is√≠n Harrington",2166,"7 months ago",5,"This place is the best Caf√© in Cork. Owned by such a friendly family, the best customer service you'll get.

The team has completely changed the way I experience coffee, turning it into a moment of joy, whether I‚Äôm alone or with others. They‚Äôve brought to Cork a warm, Mediterranean-style appreciation for the little things in life, reminding me of the sweet slow-life of southern Europe.
Thank you for creating such a happy space and for always being the friendliest!"
"Coffee Scape",43,"Maria Isabel Restrepo Velez",1618,"a month ago",5,"The coffee here is great, and the sweets and cakes are just as lovely, but what really makes this place special is the people. Their warmth and kindness are nicer than anything you could buy.

It‚Äôs the kind of spot where you can sit back, relax, and truly enjoy your evening. I love coming here, it‚Äôs my favorite place in town to sit and chat with friends."

The homemade pastries and snacks, prepared fresh right in front of you, are simply delicious. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, making you feel like you've stepped into a friend's home. The friendly staff and cozy decor add to the charm. Additionally, you can enjoy a trendy outdoor seating area by the river. If you appreciate great coffee, tasty treats, and a welcoming environment, this cafe is a must-visit!"
"The Alibi Bar + Kitchen",52,"James Rigby",1151,"3 weeks ago",5,"What a perfect bar in Cork City on Washington St. the downstairs has a classic old school feel with real bartenders and cocktails and the upstairs is like a boutique sports lounge.  The two ladies who were the bartenders were so professional and helpful, helping us to watch NFL American Football
The food was as good as the service, including burgers and sandwiches.
I really can‚Äôt say enough about the staff here, truly 5 star!"
"Coffee Scape",43,"Amaia Medina P√©rez",161,"10 months ago",5,"I've been coming to this cafe a lot lately since it's close to my house and I couldn't be happier. They make the best mocha I've ever tasted and on top of that they are super nice. Both the guy and the girls who attend you are always pending and are super nice. I recommend üíØ this place apart from the fact that it is at the river and having a coffee in the sun overlooking the river is worth it, and more adding the good experience that is to be there.
Another important fact is that you can be with the computer working and studying, as there are many cafes that do not allow you to work and study."
"Coffee Scape",43,"Carol Moura",423,"a month ago",5,"This is the best coffee i have been to in Cork. Great variety of drinks and incredible cake! The staff is very friendly, especially Jacob, who was so nice to me and my friend! Will definitely come back!"

It was savory, crunchy and was seasoned perfectly. I ate in the little garden there is behind, it was a lovely place with a great atmosphere.

"Paper Boys",44,"keithlee spangler",1399,"5 months ago",5,"Truly the best breakfast I‚Äôve had in Ireland - honestly maybe ever? At first I was bummed because I wanted the chicken & waffle I saw on the menu pictured here (it was dated, though). I thought about skipping to eat somewhere else but one of the staff said they instead do fried chicken & French toast so I had to try it.

It‚Äôs absolutely INCREDIBLE. The French toast is almost like a kouign-amann or croissant bun and the fried chicken is the absolute best I‚Äôve ever had. Wild that that‚Äôs true of Ireland :)

The chicken was perfectly spicy, perfectly cooked, and stayed crunchy but juicy the entire meal. Blown away. I also got an iced dirty chia and it was really good. I find the seating a bit uncomfortable but manageable (even as a large person).

Highly recommend - must try."
"Paper Boys",44,"Kayla Kelly",1392,"6 months ago",5,"Believe the reviews, seriously the best food I‚Äôve had so far in Ireland, which I‚Äôm sure could be controversial. Amazing food, describing wouldn‚Äôt do justice. Drinks were also perfect!"

"Paper Boys",44,"Orla",1953,"10 months ago",5,"A good choice of items on the menu and really friendly and accommodating staff. The space is small and cosy.

The chicken was freshly made, I was afraid it was pre-made, store bought chicken but it wasn‚Äôt! Previously, I got a loaded potato with chicken, I don‚Äôt recommend that combination tho. Also, the first time I came here, the kitchen was closed, but the workers were so nice they made me a falafel salad bowl. This was a very filling, post-workout meal (5 stars)"

The live music was lovely and the vibe felt really Irish.
But, the bathrooms (men and women) could easily be improved.  2 of our glasses weren't perfectly clean, we like to hope it's stains from the dishwasher!
The ashtrays could be emptied more often especially during busy nights.
We had a good time there, but would visit other pubs before coming back."

"Bierhaus",48,"Kevin McCabe",1426,"Edited 2 years ago",5,"One of the best beer selections in Cork city, if not the entire county. Eclectic atmosphere with good views out onto the river and road. The beer list really is quite impressive. A rare spot that (from what I could tell) does not even serve Irish stout. They also have a healthy selection of (mostly Irish) whiskey. They do serve a few wines and also have other spirits at the bar for anyone not interested in a beer or whiskey. Looked like they also serve or allow you to order pizza, as there was a small menu there. Highly recommend for global beer travelers/lovers."

It was like a sketch from Fawlty Towers sitcom. Absolute disgrace no other people in the bar to be served, so I guess filling online orders & the customers sitting weren‚Äôt important at all. Took a refund & left, what a joke of an establishment, no respect for customers, at least have the manners to tell us this as soon as the order went in, there was just two of us how hard could it be to cook a few burgers, it‚Äôs not rocket science. I had spoken to the bar staff before we ordered about booking for a group next week which I now wouldn‚Äôt dream of doing. Would never recommend ye to anyone for food. Very nice bar staff who were left to deal with it too which is also unfair all I could say to the lad was no problem it‚Äôs not your fault."

"The Black Market",53,"Ciaran Chestnutt",510,"a week ago",5,"A nice different market to experience in cork other than the marina market which I'm sure takes all the attention. I really liked the vibe in here and how it felt more permanent of a place. It would be great if it was bigger but I can see clearly why it isn't. Only issue I have is that it is hard to find parking. That's nit really an issue with the place at all though."
"The Black Market",53,"Sue Sue",2416,"8 months ago",5,"First time here and my only regret is that I haven‚Äôt been before.
We had the Chicken and Bacon Souvlaki (skewers) meal deal from Taste of Home unit.. absolutely delicious, so fresh and filling. Staff were lovely as well and all for just ‚Ç¨15 with a drink.
In addition we also had a spicy Neapolitan pizza from Burnt, it wins hands down for one of the best pizzas I have tasted in years!
Could not  recommend The Black Market any more highly.  We parked in the overflow car park with no issues whatsoever‚Ä¶ just be aware of the speed bumps there which are hard to see."
"The Black Market",53,"Giacomo Corti",960,"a month ago",4,"Really cool food court in a warehouse, loved the post modern vibe and the restaurants built in containers.
We had dinner with pies, served with mash and pickled veggies. They were amazing and flavourful, unfortunately one of us got sick after the vegetarian one. Still, recommended if you look for a quiet place out of the city centre.
We did not find no alcoholic beverages so don't expect them here"
"The Black Market",53,"Jorge Garc√≠a",1293,"11 months ago",5,"It's a amaaazing place that is quiet and not noisy. The owner has always been very nice and attentive to us and our furry friends whenever we've visited. Nice coffee too. I recommend it wholeheartedly."
"The Black Market",53,"Allen Odonoghue",152,"a month ago",5,"Great spot for good food, and all the options look good. We got pizza from Di Tuccio which the kids loved, and the staff here at Di Tuccios were so nice and helpful. I would definitely recommend them. We also tried DIPS Asian cuisine, where the noodles were fantastic. Looking forward to returning to try some of the other foods."
"The Black Market",53,"Kevin McCabe",1426,"2 years ago",5,"Really liked this little spot and can imagine it being a very busy place for lunch time, given the surrounding commerce in the area. I was a bit early, at around noon, and there were only a few patrons. There were only 3 spots open when I was there‚Ä¶Dips Asian, Brendan‚Äôs Burritos, and Soma Coffee (which also serves breakfast I believe). There is LOTS of bench seating and it seemed to be dog friendly with bowls of water available. It‚Äôs a fairly small car park (I imagine most walk from the surrounding area), and there are bathrooms available on the exterior of the building. Not open Monday or Tuesday."

Dunnes Caf√© is a place that myself and my family always go at least once every two weeks. I got even better after the remodeling!

Great breakfast buffet, we paid ‚Ç¨5.25 for a 5 items buffet including tea or coffee.

They also have a pretty decent salad and sandwich buffet.

Absolutely worth trying"

"Dunnes Caf√©",54,"Zoe Fleming",2656,"a year ago",2,"Used to love this place after getting amazing mocha frapes for super cheap however after my encounter with staff today I will not be returning. I ordered my usual mocha frappe however the staff member making it seemed to not be paying attention and made the drink in a weird way (I‚Äôm no barista so I‚Äôll look past that) but after receiving the drinks they were 90% frothy milk. Unable to drink thru a straw and when I got the slightest taste it was nothing like it usually is. It had way too much coffee in it.
After going back and asking if it was possible to have it remade I was met with the staff smirking at each other and not giving me an answer.
As someone with extreme anxiety I‚Äôm trying to get better about speaking up for myself but this has set me back majorly. I was given a shrug and asked what I wanted so I just grabbed a lemonade.
Really disappointed"

What I liked is that they asked do you want a small or large, it‚Äôs the same amount of coffee just more water. Happy they clarified that for me. Very friendly staff. The pastries and food offerings looked very good, but didn‚Äôt partake this time. Liked the atmosphere and it looked like everyone was enjoying themselves in a coffeehouse kind of way. Also lots of seating outside along the river and road. It seems to be communal and shared amongst the many shops there? Maybe not. But seating outside if desired."

We were there last Saturday night and it was spilling over with loud, arguably rude youth. (20ish-year olds) I got a half pint of Beamish and tried to get out as quickly as possible. Maybe another night I'd of liked the place. It vibed bad intentions, like high school angst. I don't know a better way to explain it. I'm more into chill/older crowd. Cute pub though.

With a vast selection of home made food and a great variety on the menu that serves breakfast lunch dinner along with other selections you will definitely find something to enjoy in a calming, nice, natural location surrounded by nature.

The caf√© felt it was better suited for meeting friends for tea + cake (the chocolate browny was very good) then anything more substantial. Paid over ‚Ç¨70 for sandwiches, soup, pot of very weak tea for a handful of people (‚Ç¨9 sandwich was poor value for money for example, soup had far too much pepper).

Roll on the years  it's been my local for about the last 6 or 7 years as I've lived in the city . Maybe a little biased but seriously , the best bar I've ever come across , the locals , now friends , are welcoming to newcomers , it's a city pub so the banter and messing is great , I play darts to a decent level so I joined the team and am still there , now I play for the pool team also . The atmosphere is friendly and inviting , if your looking for sports , this is the place , so many screens , different games on each depending on what people want . 2 pool tables , 8 darts boards , poker nights on Thursday , never any trouble either . If you want to sit in peace at a table and have your own space no problem either . And lastly the staff , absolute gems , couldn't be more welcoming and friendly , they quickly become friends . It's like walking into your sitting room with a fire on , you can engage or chill and enjoy . Hands down my favourite bar in the city ‚ù§Ô∏è they accommodate music , events , supporters clubs , music every Sunday night . No 1 in cork üíØüëåüèº"
"The Gallows Bar",62,"Dmitry Pashin",729,"2 years ago",5,"Probably the best pub in Cork.
Definitely the best pint of Murphies.
I lost all games in Snooker but nevertheless atmosphere is fantastic.
Friendly and peaceful.
Best barmens. Thank you."
"The Gallows Bar",62,"Silke White",2333,"3 years ago",5,"I love that bar and the staff is really nice.
We were there the last couple of weeks on mondays for darts ( summer competition ) and at the start there was no spiced Bacardi. We mentioned it to Dave and he got it for us for the next Monday.
Very nice outside area to sit too and everything is very clean!!"

"The Gallows Bar",62,"The Maker",2469,"2 years ago",4,"Prices for beer among the best in Cork. Nice atmosphere if you're looking fof a sports bar type place. I wouldn't call it traditional style pub. It's got multiple rooms and is less cozy than traditional oubs like The Welcome Inn."

The birthday boy was happy. Highly recommended."
"The Courtyard on Sober Lane",63,"Cynthia Miller",584,"a week ago",4,"Stopped by on a rainy day and basically had the place to ourselves. Beautiful place and good food. Service started fantastic but our servers shift ended before we finished and the person that took over wasn't the best."
"The Courtyard on Sober Lane",63,"Jason Anthony Biggs",1169,"a month ago",4,"I been here many times over the years it is a lovely spot for food and drink.

"The Courtyard on Sober Lane",63,"Nick Harvey",1889,"4 months ago",5,"An amazing experience in an industry that can be complacent.
Lovely venue with a high end vibe, even better when a sunny afternoon in May.
Tyrone the manager, is an old school publican who wants his clientele to have an experience.
If you don't visit this place on your trip, you're missing an open space area that caters for sun, shade and good staff."
"Mason at Tuckey St",67,"Olivia Carr",1941,"3 years ago",1,"I recommend you advertise changing your closing time to 11.30.  Bouncer refused us at 11.20 saying they were closing soon, despite 4 people on the chairs outside just being served as we walked up to the door."

"The Courtyard on Sober Lane",63,"anna cotugno",223,"a month ago",1,"I recently celebrated a Hen Party here with my friends, planning to enjoy the sun and their barbecue. Unfortunately, things didn‚Äôt go quite as expected.

First off, we were told over the phone that a bottle of Prosecco was 27 euros, but when we got there, it was suddenly 39 euros per bottle. And to top it off, we had to carry the bottles to our table ourselves, basically self-service even for the Prosecco.

The barbecue was decent, and the food was okay. We had booked for around 15 people, but only 12 actually had the barbecue. Still, the manager insisted we pay for all 15 portions because they claimed the food was already prepared. I get that, but it would‚Äôve been nice if they‚Äôd told us upfront that they‚Äôd cook for 15 no matter what. At least then we could have figured out a way to use the extra food or save it for later.

We spent the whole afternoon and evening there, eating and drinking, which added up to quite a bill. When it was time to pay, I asked the manager if we could take the leftover food for dinner since we‚Äôd paid for it. What they gave us was really disappointing cold, dry meat that seemed like it had been out for ages, just wrapped in foil with bread. No chips, no salad, nothing. Given that we paid for the full menu, it felt really unfair.

All in all, the service, especially from the manager, was pretty poor, and it felt like they didn‚Äôt care much about the customers. It was a letdown, especially for such a special occasion."
"The Courtyard on Sober Lane",63,"Carla Cabral",420,"4 months ago",1,"I had a deeply disappointing and upsetting experience at this bar last night. We had a table reservation for 8 PM, and our friends arrived gradually due to work and other commitments. The last few arrived around 11:30 PM and were greeted by the manager in an extremely rude and, frankly, racist manner. He told them this ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt a community centre‚Äù and that the bar was already closed.

At that point, they were already greeting us at our table‚Äîit was obvious they were part of our group. We were still drinking, and at no time had anyone informed us that the bar was closing. Had we known, we would have arranged a different meeting point for those arriving later.

To make matters worse, the bar was still full of customers at other tables, and no one else seemed to be treated in the same way. The way we were spoken to and singled out made us feel humiliated and disrespected. It was clear to us that we were being treated differently because we are not Irish.

No one should ever be made to feel unwelcome or discriminated against in a public place. I sincerely hope the management takes this feedback seriously and ensures no other customer has to go through the same kind of experience."
"The Courtyard on Sober Lane",63,"H H",1003,"a month ago",1,"I've been going here on and off for a number of years with work events. Today was is the first time ever that we've been refused a pint of water(while also ordering drinks). It was 23+¬∞ and we had collectively spent about ‚Ç¨300 so far that evening. The bar person/manager proceeded to shout at us for having the audacity to order water... We will be taking our business elsewhere from now on. We are all business men and women. It is astonishing that water is a bode of contention."

Food was very tasty and the crowd around us was lively."
"Woolshed Baa & Grill - Cork",64,"Mr Walsh",1829,"3 months ago",5,"Visited the Wool Shed Bar and Grill and they have a nice menu I went with the Chips and Pulled Pork simply because it was the only meal on the menu that came with chips.

It is definitely very popular for the price of ‚Ç¨9.90 as I seen staff going back and forth to different tables with this meal. I would of going with the Chicken for ‚Ç¨18 euros but for such a pricey chicken it do not come with a few chips. If chips was added to that menu item and other menu items they would definitely sell a lot more from the menu.

The pulled pork and chips were very tasty and filling definitely worth the price. Cooked well. The service from the staff was excellent checking to see if all was ok. The girl that took the order was very nice and very helpful with explaining the menu.

The Mardyke Entertainment Venue is very large as it has a large snooker and pool section. It has bowling lanes and there is an open air rooftop area. Downstairs more seating for large groups for food and dinning.

Also another small bar with arcade games called the Barcadia. The main downstairs pub has  plenty of screens with lots of choices to watch different sports. This entertainment venue has it all.

Great staff great service and great food.

Would just add that if the meals came with chips as standard the meals would definitely be value for money and add more variety and would sell more."
"Woolshed Baa & Grill - Cork",64,"Georgia H.",948,"5 months ago",5,"My favorite spot in Cork. The atmosphere of this place is unmatched, and they have the best staff around. I always come here for my football matches, they always try to put them on for me even though they're international matches. Food is amazing- especially the dadinhos!! They also have corona on tap which I've yet to find at any other Cork bar. Have a great pub quiz and music bingo hosted here too. It's really the place to be."

"Woolshed Baa & Grill - Cork",64,"Lily Rose",1517,"Edited a year ago",5,"Good spot with comfortable atmosphere to visit during the day, and a great spot to catch an early football match. We lucked out by checking their Instagram story and managed to get a code for a free wings and pint of Heineken each worth about ‚Ç¨20 each - Worth checking out if you plan to stop in here just in case! Wings were lovely and the pint was a pint. üëç
It should be noted that this whole venue is 21+ ALL DAY on Saturday (also Friday I believe) but they make exceptions to families. We saw two 18 year old lads with IDs get turned away at around 2pm, while there were actual toddlers wandering around inside. Odd rule so plan ahead! Nice if you're older as it's a less messy atmosphere than some of the 18+ bars in the city on the weekend."

So we proceeded to the bar, had a drink, looked for a table and eventually ordered meals. After a few minutes, the waiter appears out of nowhere to request our ID. Two of my friends forgot to bring it, but they had it on their phones. We were halfway through our drinks when one of the security ladies told us to leave since we didn't have ID. How is this fair? Are they being racist? They literally told us to get out! It‚Äôs their fault if that was the case they should have not allowed us to get in at the first place. Worst experience. Never been treated like this before. They cancelled our food order and we had to sip our drinks so quickly cause we paid for it already."

Also the prices in front of the restaurant are not exact, it is not right to not put a menu up to date in front of your facility (the price difference was very big for instance 11 to 17‚Ç¨  actually)

Michael ran a high-class French restaurant in the old manor house for many years, which he had to give up for health reasons. Now he runs the B&B here. The house and the rooms are reminiscent of the glory days. You can feel the passion and dedication with which Michael runs his house when you ask him about its history.
Instead of spending the evening in town, we decided to buy food at the Take Away, especially as Michael offered to set a table for us in the old restaurant. It was a wonderful evening in a unique atmosphere. Better than any pub could have been...
If you're expecting high technology here, you might be disappointed. But if you appreciate old glamour and real style, you will find a wonderful B&B here.
Unfortunately, due to low demand, he no longer offers breakfast. We're sure it would have been fabulous. Thank you so much for the wonderful time, Michael."

The only negative is I think it should come with mash/chips. It wouldn't fill me on its own so I ordered chips separately. The dessert was unreal..i got a peanut butter jelly amd honeycomb parfait type. Would recommend."
"Gallagher's Cork",71,"Daniel Farrelly",616,"3 months ago",4,"We stumbled upon this place while looking for somewhere to eat one evening. The vegetable pakoras we had to start were nice. The vegan burger (which was ordered without hummus) was very dry and the bun had an odd texture. This might have been because it was a vegan brioche bun. The cauliflower steak was delicious and is definitely the best veggie/vegan option to go for.

The service was impeccable and the staff were very accommodating, despite our lack of a reservation. Our meal (with two pints) came to ‚Ç¨65."

The pie was well made - very hot but letting it crack open and mixing the ingredients helped bring it to an eating temperature. The meat was slow cooked and tender and flavored well.

The cocktails were impressive, the fries were good, we liked the burgers too. The fish and chips look well portioned.

Solid pub experience."

"Bunsen",72,"Mr Walsh",1829,"4 months ago",5,"A very tasty burger at the Bunsen restaurant, ordered just the plain burger to see how it tasted. It is a very big burger and for the price at almost ‚Ç¨10 euros with the cost of living gone so high and vat rates for business. I have to admit it was value for money.
The burger was cooked to perfection and nice and juicy and was served by two great attentive and welcoming waitresses.
Also ordered the chips and was glad to see a very large portion served as a lot of places are serving very little. Plenty of seating inside and outside. Service was nice and quick the time it took to cook the burger was the waiting time.
Your table is also served with a big jug of fresh cold water which is an extra nice part of the service. There is also a nice selection of condiments on your table for free such as different sauces and mayonnaise. The staff were great and had pride in their work. It has a nice simple little menu if you like your burgers I would recommend trying the food and service here."

Usually seated right away depending on time of visit.
Good for a quick bite.

Personal pet peeve:
- Acknowledgement of 'tips' during payment: find it odd for a fast food to bring it to your attention about 'Tipping'.
It's almost as if it's expected for someone doing their job, that they're already being paid for?
Imagine applying that to every other profession.

Really put me off from visiting the establishment and especially, if you've been to Bunsen since they've opened and their burgers used to be priced from ‚Ç¨7; find this practice to be really strange."

Food is nice i liked the chips with potato skin on it. Milkshake was lovely. Burger was big well cooked piping hot. Only issue i had was the menu. Normally when you look at a Burger menu they have it written underneath what's in it. Yes there was topping section in the menu but it didn't say anything about cheese so i thought all burgers had cheese in it which i was wrong. So it be great if they could fix the menu make it more detailed."

"Cr√®me French Tacos",74,"Brian Kessler",377,"2 months ago",3,"Dear Owners,

I‚Äôll start with the positive: The food is as good as ever!!!

But, and this a huge BUT:√§ for me:

I was most disappointed to deal with a machine to place my order. Not only that, and most likely the fault is with me, I could not customize the order as I used to when I dealt with a person (how does one order your delicious crispy onions on a bowl???)

I understand that this is probably the way of the future, and yes, you may call me a Luddite, but as someone who wants to support a local business in their community I‚Äôd rather support people than a machine.

I know, these things are about margins and what not. I am sure a machine is a lot cheaper to run and most likely more efficient than a person.

I would argue that you lost your human touch. You are hiding behind a machine.

Again, the food (cooked by people) was as great as ever. The experience was McDonald‚Äôs‚Ä¶"

So none of it is wasted and that messiness that usually comes with tacos and kebabs doesn't happen. Great value a very small dinning in area but great for a takeaway as it is prepared quickly and served by nice and friendly staff that explained the ingredients. Lots of other options on the menu.

Starters:
1. Paneer Tikka: Good seasoning, but very hard paneer. Chutney was okay, but not the best.
2. Samosa chaat: It was good.

Main course:
1. Dal makhani: A lot of people loke Coriander‚Äôs dal makhani and it has been my favourite too. But this time, it wasn‚Äôt the best in taste, the spices were less, I am not sure what was missing but something was.
2. Paneer lababdar: It wasn‚Äôt paneer lababdar for sure. There were grilled paneer cubes, which lababdar always uses normal paneer. As was the case of the starter, the paneer was too hard to eat.
There were big chunks of onion and capsicum, which are generally put in Kadhai paneer. My mood dipped after eating this paneer gravy dish.
Butter naan: Not good as per expectations. It was thick, not cooked properly.

I have been to Coriander previously as well and the food was amazing (few months back). But this time it was totally different and dissatisfying.

Service was normal as usual, could always be better."

I was going to put  the e1.oo change in tip jar until I realised she wasn't going to give me any change!

"Ramen Anglesea Street",80,"uday kalyani",2552,"2 years ago",4,"We're fancy trying Asian street food and this place was suggested. Ordered Pad Thai and Veg Curry. Pad Thai was absolutely a delight and definitely recommend this to anyone looking for veg options. They added Tofu instead of chicken which was brilliant. Veg curry was a bit blunt and not what we expected it to taste based on our previous experience with same curry in Thailand. Rice needs a special attention as it wasnt cooked properly. Not the best ambience, but perhaps is sufficient as the dine in space is really tight. 10/10 to the staff!"
"Ramen Anglesea Street",80,"H. Sipahi",1004,"2 months ago",2,"The worst asian food I've ever had. I ordered veggie wok + chicken. It was like a soup but full of soy sauce. Also, chicken was absolutely dehydrated and the rice!!!! Microwave rice with terrible taste. Absolutely, don't go here. Also had to wait for takeout for 25 min for this food really ridiculous."
"Ramen Anglesea Street",80,"Shridhyey Gupta",2329,"9 months ago",1,"I ordered Singapore noodles with Tofu as a takeaway. The menu says it's vegan however there were eggs in it.
Disappointed with this. Would never recommend as I had requested while placing the order to avoid it.

Edit - I had requested a Vegan option mentioning while adding Tofu with it and specifically requested to avoid any contamination and was assured the same."
"Ramen Anglesea Street",80,"Ciara S",508,"3 years ago",3,"This place was quite empty when I went and filled up a bit by the time I left. The service was good, someone took my order quickly and the food was delivered to my table in about 3 or 4 minutes. I also like that you pay when you order.
The food itself was not nice at all. The portion size was big but the dish tasted kind of sweet and was unbelievably oily. The tofu was very nice."
"Ramen Anglesea Street",80,"Aditeya",53,"5 years ago",5,"There is a lot that goes into the dining experience at Ramen. The staff here is friendly and warm, and are extremely pleasant to talk to.

Other than that, we get complimentary fortune cookies and ice creams with our meal. Absolutely love this place!"

We went in for a couple of drinks but ended up having way more than a couple, due to the great atmosphere and friendly staff. The barman, Alan, is a cocktail genius; if you don‚Äôt see something on the menu just ask and he was great to explain the different ones on the menu (his margarita and old fashions are things of beauty) .

The cocktails were lovely, great selection and very tasty.

We were allowed bring in chips from Lennox chipper next door and that was brilliant, it meant we could stay longer and keep our table together.

Would highly recommend and would visit again.

Have to say that the Alan the bar man on last night (Fri 16th) was an absolute delight. Alan was so helpful and pleasant, nothing was an issue, he provided brilliant service to everyone and really added to the evening. He is a total asset to the business."

The food is fresh and we'll thought out. The flavors and textures are clearly forward-thinking without being pretentious or ""trying too hard."" We had the Huevos Rancheros, Berry French Toast, Bacon French Toast, and the Smokey Royale. All were delicious. The smoked salmon with its delicious oils, paired nicely with the slightly acid avocado base on the toast and the lemon in the hollandaise.
The Rancheros had a wonderful ""western"" flavor with very tender, not fatty, pork.
The French Toast was pefect. Light and crisp with bright flavors."

Fish cake was tasty nothing special. The steak is the issue. Literally could have used a chainsaw to cut it. Our table was shaking and our drinks were spilling because we were trying to cut the steak. It lacked flavour and just wasn‚Äôt worth the price. Won‚Äôt be ordering that again.

The Classic burger it's self was a 6oz monster it felt moe like a very tasty double quarter pounder. One of the most messiest and tastiest burgers I had in long time. Glad I could just about finish it.
Be prepared, this is a delicious juicy messy burger! Fast service great chef, great bar staff. The inside of the pub the decor and vibe is decorated very interestingly and very cozy. Grabs your attention where ever you look.  The DJ box made of a little camper van is a great centre piece. It also has  a football table machine for a bit of fun."

"An Br√≥g Bar + Kitchen",86,"Julian C",1318,"2 months ago",3,"Atmosphere is unreal, but the only issue is the staff, left with my friend for two minutes and couldn't get back in, the bouncer said he ""didn't see us leave"" after making direct eye contact while leaving. Our phones and coates were still inside, and we only got them back after my friends sister brought them out. Great Atmosphere, but genuinely hostile and unreasonable bouncers."

"An Br√≥g Bar + Kitchen",86,"Danilo Matias",624,"4 months ago",1,"The place is amazing, with great music and fun weekly activities. However, there‚Äôs something more important than everything else to me: the staff! I visited on a public holiday, and one of the staff members was incredibly aggressive and unhappy. An alternative lady, who was supposed to be helpful, had an inadequate posture with me and my friend because we didn‚Äôt want to participate in the Quiz. It was unnecessary and some people really don‚Äôt know how to work in a hospitality service. Unfortunately, it seems like the company is lost in this situation because there are 100 others pubs in Cork where this kind of behavior is not tolerated."

"An Br√≥g Bar + Kitchen",86,"Travis Brink",2536,"a year ago",4,"Went there because they're open later than the other bars that close at 11:30. Younger, boisterous late night crowd which is ideal for partiers and boisterous youths, which clearly didn't deter me from staying til closing. I was surprised to find out the next day that the alleyway was an entrance to the English Market near the fishmongers. I was also surprised to learn they also serve food, which I didn't know about until just now when I began to write this review so I can't really speak to that. Decent beers, healthy shot pours, and late night hours."
"Jacques Restaurant",87,"Paul Richard Bungay",2018,"a month ago",4,"We went on a team night out and the place and atmosphere of this place is class. It might look very small at the outside but very big on the inside.Their servers was very approachable and accommodating as well. Food was ok for me. I would say my expectations were a little bit not met. For a 30-40 euro steak, I would have expected that the steak is at least seasoned which was not. The sharing platter as well was a little bit  small for me. I expected at least a couple of meats and more cheese on a meat and cheese board but as you can see on the picture that‚Äôs their sharing board and you can see on the menu how much that is. My teammates enjoyed their veggie board and they were delighted with the taste. Their desert was great as well. Overall still a good experience. Just get your wallets ready as food can be pricey."
"Jacques Restaurant",87,"Mark Mirigian",1659,"5 months ago",5,"Wonderful dining experience and friendly staff. The tomahawk is seasoned well and big enough to share.

‚úîÔ∏èMussels escabeche
‚úîÔ∏èRoast quail

Delightful dinner affair with impeccable ambiance, in my humble opinion. After a futile search through four restaurants, stumbling upon this gem was a stroke of luck. I had noticed it during a leisurely evening stroll and was instantly captivated.

The warm welcome upon entry sealed the deal for me; the charming lady and the attentive staff were absolute darlings, truly enhancing my evening.

Starting with the mussels was a light and flawless choice. When I spotted quail on the menu, I knew it was meant for me. The creamy polenta resembled a heavenly bed, complemented by a delicate touch of pesto oil that harmonized all the flavors beautifully. The quail itself was cooked to perfection, just as I prefer."

"Jacques Restaurant",87,"Dessie Hristov",719,"3 years ago",4,"Expected more, however it was a good experience. The bartender, who happens to be our waitress as well, was polite and helpful. We had the crab arancini (not excited about those), the pork belly (good!), The stuffed mushrooms (good!), The duck salad (highly recommend!!!). Extensive cocktails and wines on the menu. Place was a bit empty but the atmosphere, the setting was very welcoming!
I would recommend it!"

We went at 1 pm on a Tuesday so maybe it was a good time as others have told me it is super busy in the mornings and weekends. It was expensive enough, especially for only one piece of toast with the eggs Benedict, but everything was delicious so we will probably come again. Pancakes were delicious and coffees were great!"

"Cafe Spresso",90,"Viktor Danielian",2577,"11 months ago",5,"One of the best breakfast places I‚Äôve tried in Ireland. Came to Ireland to run a Dublin marathon and been dining in lots of places. This place stands out with large menu, affordable prices and excellent service. Tomasz is cooking everything himself in the back and everything tastes delicious. Would highly recommend this place!"
"Cafe Spresso",90,"Melanie Tam",1736,"a month ago",3,"Our first breakfast in Ireland had to be a full Irish breakfast, of course. I found Cafe Spresso, which was a short walk from our hotel, and it had pretty good reviews. It was a Monday at around 11 AM, and there was probably only one other table dining. The menu looked like it was a mix of Irish and Hungarian cuisine. We ordered the large Full Irish Breakfast (2 bacon, 2 sausages, 2 eggs, black and white pudding, mushrooms, beans, tomato, toast, tea or coffee) and one of the Hungarian specials, a meat croquette, which comes with a cup of beetroot soup. The Irish Breakfast was good - oily, like you‚Äôd expect. It did the trick. It‚Äôs enough to share between two people, just because it‚Äôs so greasy. I would skip the croquette. It was definitely left over from the night (or maybe more) before. It was soggy and salty. I did enjoy the beetroot soup, but I didn‚Äôt want to mix too much of it with the coffee I was already drinking.

Cafe Spresso is a good option for a full Irish brekkie, which is only ‚Ç¨12! But I would just stick to that."

Highly recommended!"
"Cafe Spresso",90,"Jenn A",1191,"a month ago",5,"We went for breakfast! Great spot. There was just one gentleman working so it wouldn't be the best for a quick meal, but it was very tasty. If we stayed longer we would've loved to check out some other menu options!"
"The Castle Blackrock - Neighbourhood Restaurant",337,"Thomas Philpott",2484,"a month ago",5,"This restaurant is beautiful with exceptional staff. The whole customer experience from beginning to end was amazing. I initially rang up as my sister is coeliac and the man emailed the separate menu to me straight away. When I went inside I was waiting for 2 other people. The waiter noticed I had birthday presents for my sister and took note of her name to sing happy birthday. Food was very nice and very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend if you are looking for somewhere special or just casual lunch."
"The Floury Apron",4,"M. Barry",1590,"a year ago",5,"Fantastic food with quality ingredients. Nearest thing to home cooking I've had at a restaurant. Had a lunch of coronation chicken wrap and a side salad and coffee. Also excellent value for money."
"Orchids Restaurant",91,"Rob Hale",2133,"2 months ago",4,"Overall this establishment offered a solid dining experience with high quality food and friendly professional service. Evening service seemed a bit short staffed which did not allow our server to present herself as frequently as we would have preferred. I do not fault the server as this seemed to be more of a staffing issue.  Obvious regulars two tables down were fawned upon while hotel guests, such as ourselves, did not get the same service level. For the price of both the hotel and the restaurant this was disappointing. Breakfast service was a bit spotty.  The first morning it was exceptional. The second morning it was a bit off. The food quality for all meals was excellent and the plate presentations were well done. The dining room itself was classy contemporary.  Noise volumes allowed conversations to be heard. A good 4 star experience."
"Orchids Restaurant",91,"Google User",983,"2 years ago",5,"From the moment we walked in we felt a special level of service and attention. The prix fixe menu of three courses delighted everyone at our table. The wine pairings were a perfect accompaniment. The lamb starter melted in your mouth. The salmon, lamb tenderloin and Irish Beef were cooked perfectly. We will always dine at Orchids when we are in Cork. Ambience was tranquil with the lovely piano singer in the lobby just outside the restaurant. Highly recommend."
"Orchids Restaurant",91,"Vitali Babi",2586,"7 months ago",5,"Great place for a relaxed evening!

A fantastic spot to unwind and enjoy live music in a top-notch atmosphere. Everything is well thought out ‚Äì from the interior to the excellent service. The food is absolutely exquisite and delicious. Yes, it‚Äôs a bit on the pricey side, but worth every euro.

"Z√≥calo",93,"Gary Murphy",925,"9 months ago",2,"A nice place and friendly staff but the food left a lot to be desired. The fish taco was drowning in a watery white sauce that left the  battered fish completely soggy. I couldn‚Äôt finish it.
The guacamole was dry, missing lime and salt. Just look at the picture. No relation to Mexican food.
In fairness to the staff, they were welcoming and are trying the best but clearly not familiar with Mexican cuisine."
"Z√≥calo",93,"Sasha O‚ÄôKeeffe",2268,"2 months ago",5,"Had some amazing food here, it‚Äôs a bit pricey but the big portions make it worth your money, staff were lovely and very accommodating. Food is so flavoursome and it‚Äôs easy to tell they use the proper ingredients. Good vegan options and loads of sauce and food options for picky eaters too and you can customise your foods too which is great."
"Z√≥calo",93,"susie jones",2424,"7 months ago",1,"Ordered the ""you got Mango"" with chicken via deliveroo, Food was freezing when delivered and the meat was Brown, slimey.. and stale tasting. It wasn't coloured from the marinade it was more like the dark meat of the chicken, you should really rethink your prices if you're adding the scraps of a carcus into a taco.  Had to throw it out. Absolutely disgusting and very disappointing. Also ye wouldn't refund it on Deliveroo."

A bowl of soggy rice, smothered in Sauce & dark carcass chicken,expecting breast meat.

Never again, I feel nauseous thinking of it."
"Z√≥calo",93,"Billy Fajardo",345,"9 months ago",2,"I wanted tho try their nachos. I added the beef and at first they looked very promising. The bit of visible grease was ok, however as I got to the bottom it seems that I got a free helping of the frying grease. There‚Äôs really no reason for this. I couldn‚Äôt finish as what my shoulder be crisp nacho chips were nothing but a soggy cholesterol raising mess of oil and salt. I don‚Äôt think I will be trying them again . Not what I expect for 15‚Ç¨"
"Z√≥calo",93,"Rabin Bhandari",2076,"Edited a year ago",5,"I recently visited Zocalo Restaurant and was thoroughly impressed by the experience. The Tacos are absolutely amazing‚Äîpacked with fresh ingredients and bursting with flavor. I tried the Hard Shell Food Truck Taco and Burger and it was one of the best I‚Äôve ever had. The portion sizes are generous and well worth the price."
"Miyazaki Japanese Take Away",108,"Sun Lee",2417,"a week ago",4,"Really good rice on the onigiri- the size is gigantic!!

The gyudon needs work, the flavors are there and the portions are nice but needs to add that raw egg for a silky texture."
"Orchids Restaurant",91,"Alex Karakatsanis",124,"4 months ago",3,"I visited the Orchid restaurant with my family and partner to celebrate my graduation. I had been wanting to visit this restaurant for the past 4 years living in Cork. Overall, I am slightly disappointed in all areas. Especially, considering its prestige and price. Starting with the food: although enjoyable; there is a lot of room for improvement. I personally tried the scallops, the duck, and the apple parfait. The scallops lacked depth of flavor, and were in my opinion overcooked. The acai sorbet, although a nice and refreshing idea, lacked any memorable qualities or garnish. The duck, although juicy and cooked right in the middle, had a very soggy skin. The orange flavor that was meant to complement it was also very mild. The desert was my favorite dish, and it was unique and tasty but my partners desert, the berry mousse, had (literally) half a strawberry served with it, then the menu said ""served with fresh berries"". The wine selection was impressive and I enjoyed our drinks, although our first pinot grigio was noticeably cheap.

The service was a mixed bag. All the servers and staff were very friendly and I have no complaints in that regard. That said, we all came with heavy coats, and no one offered to pick them up for us. Additionally, we were all asked to order desert off the bat, which is unusual and delayed our order. Finally, when we left, we had to pick up our coats our selves.

Finally on the atmosphere. This historic building should receive the utmost of respect and attention in decor. The flooring, armchairs, curtains, chandeliers and room layout did not honor its history. The small details, such as lighting, and set up (uninviting spotlights, grey plastic laminate flooring, one candle per table that weren't turned on etc..) do not reflect the class the restaurant should hold.

On a positive note, the live piano was lovely, and added to the experience, especially because the player himself was not only lovely, but also also highly skilled. That said, the repertoire should be adjusted, as we were confused when they started playing the game of throne TV show intro music, instead of perhaps soft jazz, or classical pieces.

Overall, I did have a great time, and i don't have anything negative to say about any particular staff, or their friendliness, but considering this restaurant is within a 5 star hotel, with a very high price range, i did not feel this was reflected in the areas stated above. Worth a visit, but I'd be more inclined to attend the afternoon tea, or the lovely bar."

"Orchids Restaurant",91,"Paul F",2009,"7 years ago",1,"What would've been a nice evening sadly was utterly ruined by three amazingly loud groups of american tourists and the incompetent staff that didn't even attempt to bring the noise down to ""european"" levels of fine dining. You're essentially paying 100$ to eat good food in a rather loud pub. On request one waiter told us to ""go to a different restaurant"". Can't recommend unless you're an annoying american."

"Rising Sons Brewery",92,"Mr Walsh",1829,"a year ago",5,"The food here is delicious filling and affordable. You can get a fresh pizza that would fill two and a pint for ‚Ç¨17 euros. All made fresh by the chef in the open kitchen. This restaurant pub is for all age groups. With a good mixture of people.
I ordered the beef Nachos and the were the best I tasted in a long time.

The portion was definitely made for two. I finished them with some difficulty very fufiling. The seating area is fantastic where you can see the hard work of the chef that goes into making the food from the open kitchen plan.

What a fantastic affordable place to eat excellent pub and restaurant with its own brewery and large selection of own brand pints. Along with all the other well known brands. The decor is fantastic there is also a large screen and plenty of televisions placed around.

The bar staff was patient with my order and had some helpful suggestions. Thanks for that. They also have one of them new card reader tipping station that are becoming popular but also accept cash. If your visiting or a local I highly recommend visiting even just for the experience. A great place for a meal."
"Rising Sons Brewery",92,"Darius",633,"2 months ago",1,"A Surprising Experience at Rising Sons Brewery

I‚Äôve always enjoyed visiting Rising Sons Brewery‚Äîwhether after work or on the weekends, it had become a bit of a regular spot for me. The bar staff have always been incredibly friendly and welcoming. I even gifted them a framed present once as a small thank-you for their hospitality, and I've always been polite and respectful in return.

On one of my recent visits, I was there with two friends to say goodbye to someone moving back to Spain. We were sitting outside enjoying the sun and I recorded a short video from outside to remember the moment. Everything seemed fine, and it was, at the time.

A few days later, I stopped by again after shopping to unwind with a pint and meet a friend. I had my first drink and was about to order a second when I was told‚Äîrather unexpectedly‚Äîthat I was barred. I was quite taken aback, especially since no explanation was given. I was simply told that I‚Äôd need to speak to the manager, who would be in at 6pm.

What surprised me most is that there was no clear reason offered, and up until that moment, I‚Äôd never had a negative interaction with anyone there. The team has always been great, so I can only assume this decision came from management. If the video I took from outside was the issue, I find that a bit confusing, as there was nothing inappropriate or disruptive about it.

In the end, while it‚Äôs disappointing, there are plenty of other great places in Cork to relax and enjoy a drink. I still appreciate the good times I had at Rising Sons, but this experience has left me puzzled."

Portions are huge! None of us could finish! So we will be eating the leftovers later tonight or for lunch tomorrow, the food we got was very fresh and well presented considering it was takeaway!

The pub wasn't overly busy at the time and I believe that this was unnecessary and unacceptable behaviour as we already ordered drinks previous to this incident and got served no problem and it was hours before closing time. It just seamed like the bartender was just in a bad mood and took it out on us.

I ordered a pizza and, for some completely ridiculous reason, was given chips. I assumed, generously, that they were included with the meal. Wrong. It turns out your staff mixed up my order with the table next to mine ‚Äî and instead of taking responsibility for your mistake, I was still forced to pay for the wrong item. Why? Because I had eaten them before being told they weren‚Äôt part of my order. That is not just absurd, it‚Äôs borderline insulting.

Meanwhile, the table whose order mine was confused with? They were given a brand new portion of chips for free ‚Äî simply because they ‚Äúhad to wait.‚Äù So let‚Äôs recap: I get the wrong order, I pay for it, and they get the right order plus a free one. If that doesn‚Äôt scream favoritism, negligence, or incompetence, I don‚Äôt know what does.

To make matters worse, your staff were shockingly rude, dismissive, and offered not a single word of apology. The way I was spoken to was completely unacceptable. And it doesn‚Äôt stop there ‚Äî on a previous visit, I was nearly short-changed ‚Ç¨20, which was brushed off with a casual ‚Äúoops üôÉ.‚Äù That alone should have been enough to never come back, but I gave you another chance. Clearly a mistake.

This experience was infuriating from start to finish. I left hungry, angry, and completely disrespected. The lack of professionalism, accountability, and basic courtesy from your staff is outrageous and unacceptable. I will be telling everyone I know to avoid your restaurant at all costs ‚Äî you‚Äôve lost a customer permanently.

"Lafayette‚Äôs",101,"Jillian Collins",1218,"10 months ago",2,"I have loved the aesthetic of Lafayette's since I was young. I rarely leave bad reviews however the standard of food is not up to scratch of that of a 4star hotel. It is clear that the majority of staff are given no training and that there is no clear management system. The last few times I've visited (I keep going back cos I love the decor in there and am always rooting for it to be a good experience). Service is slow and poor. The woman sitting at a tablw near me with a child was left waiting ages to be served, then had to ask for culery, a portion of chips came along for her table. She then had to ask when the rest of the food was coming - she had orderd fish and chips. The one excellent and compentent server had to check on it for her. After the two had finished we had a quick chat. She said to me after that they didn't even bring the right sandwich for the child but she didn't have the energy to say anything.
My own order was a glazed ham and melted brie sandwich. At least that it what the menu said. What arrived was a plain slice of bread with relish and cold slice of brie, topped with a deli sized slice of ham. The portion of chips I ordered on the side came along first, with the server saying ""Enjoy your meal,"" instead of saying ""Is there anything else I can get you?"" Having seen the experience of the lady near me, I too had to enquire if my sandwich was on the way.
This quality and service as mentioned above does not reflect the quality and standard expected from a 4 star hotel. If management of the hotel is reading this, please take time to train your staff properly i.e. getting an outside agency to train them rather than relying on more senior staff to do it and/or hire more staff.
I would recommend you take a look at how one of the city's other 4 star hotels trains and manages their staff i.e. The Metropole.
Thanks for reading,
I hope it is useful feedback to help you to improve your service. I want to reiterate that when a place is understaffed and undertrained that this is never the staff's fault but management's fault."

There was no table service or it seems option to have a sit down experience with reusable cutlery.

But my main gripe were the bathrooms. Broken taps in both. Unclean. It was just really not a nice experience. The eggs pot I got was just okay.

Take away looked much nicer to get a pastry or croissant or sweet treat. Also it was 9:10am so busy college rush time. But if you‚Äôre around campus and this is a daily occurrence they should have staffing to be able to handle that.

From the moment we stepped inside, the unique atmosphere enveloped us: warm, welcoming, yet modern and stylish. The service was simply flawless ‚Äì incredibly attentive, friendly, and passionate about what they do, which was evident in every detail.

The food was absolutely incredible. We had the pleasure of enjoying the vegan and gluten-free tasting menu with wine pairing ‚Äì and what a discovery it was! In Ireland, it's not often you find a restaurant that delivers on these requirements with such creativity and finesse. Every dish was a true work of art ‚Äì fresh ingredients, harmonious flavors, and surprising combinations that never ventured into the realm of ‚Äúordinary‚Äù or ‚Äúrun-of-the-mill.‚Äù

The aperitif that welcomed us was the perfect introduction to what was to come: sparkling, refreshing, and beautifully balanced. The first course of the menu was a creative interpretation of local seasonal ingredients, prepared with such attention to detail. It was a true taste experience! What really stood out was how each dish was not only vegan and gluten-free, but also didn‚Äôt compromise on flavor or texture in any way.

Another highlight was the wine pairing, which was perfectly matched to each course. The wines we were served were exceptional, and they complemented the food‚Äôs flavors in a stunning way. The sommelier truly knew his craft!

But what really made this experience special wasn‚Äôt just the fantastic food ‚Äì it was the heartwarming atmosphere and the exceptional staff.

"Paradiso",103,"Darragh Miller",640,NULL,NULL,"Cork long standing and outstanding Vegetarian restaurant, met sister and friends who are regulars for first visit, the ambience and dining room is intimate and warm, the welcome and service from the team is incredible, the sommelier guides you through a very well curated and delightful choice of wines with tough choices to be made with helpful and insightful suggestions and then of course the food, beautifully fresh and seasonal ingredients combined and cooked perfectly and paired with fantastic sauces that demand to be eaten and mopped up with the light and tasty bread provided, the set menu has a wonderful array of textures, hero vegetables and presentation is first class.

Laura was warm, attentive, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu.

The courses arrived at just the right pace, and she made us feel genuinely welcome throughout the meal.

It‚Äôs rare to find service that is both professional and personal, and Laura struck that balance perfectly. She truly elevated our experience."

"The Beer Garden",104,"Mr Walsh",1829,"3 months ago",5,"The food was great the prices were very expensive over the high rate of living in Ireland plus vat and tax charges. You can't blame that on the restaurants and publicans so five stars all around. Just glad now at this stage that there is still a local pub left around that can serve great food served by nice staff in a busy and yet relaxed atmosphere.

It would of being nice if the bangers and mash came with a side of gravy to pour over as an little extra as we Al like our mash and gravy different. Wings were cooked beautifully with Franks wild sauce a bit to spicy hot and vinegary for me next time must try the mild. The big jug of water was welcomed.

The burger top notch a few more chips would have been nice as we shared, great that it came with a side salad with colsaw. Nice pint of Heineken pricey ‚Ç¨6.50 but that is now the norm over the increase of living costs and trying to keep businesses open still you can find pints cheaper at the moment for now.

All in all great experience at the beer gardens great staff service and food nice cozy beer garden out the back with a screen.

Good result in the hurling for Cork V Dublin hopefully they can go all the way and lift that heavy cup in the Final."

"The Beer Garden",104,"Gavin",927,"7 months ago",5,"Big plate, BIG food, good food.
I'm typing this the next morning and I still feel full. If you can see the pics you'll see what I mean. There was a good crowd there but they were all chilled and just enjoying the evening. At first glance at the entrance you'll see what looks like just a pub ( I hate bar stool dinners personally, but this isn't the case here)  But towards the back are the tables with ample room and seating. We were waited on by a blonde lady who was great fun. The lads were very friendly too. Nothing to complain about, it came recommended and I would recommend it too. We got the early bird for ‚Ç¨21 for 2 big courses. Good food and lots of it. First time there, but not our last."

"Isaac's Restaurant",105,"Dustin Hughes",753,"a year ago",4,"This place was almost perfect. To start with, they have a great wine selection, with many different options for you to choose from. My husband and I both got the 10oz Sirloins, my steak was cooked a perfect med rare. However, my husband ordered his medium and it came out well done. They were super busy that night, so he powered through it and finished his meal. We were starving and didn't want to wait for another steak to come out. Other than that, the sides were all perfectly seasoned and the desserts were to die for. I definitely suggest getting the chocolate St. Emilion."

"Isaac's Restaurant",105,"Caroline Findlay",432,"2 years ago",5,"Superb dining experience from start to finish.

The restaurant itself is quite understated, but very elegant. Staff were all welcoming, friendly and attentive - without being overbearing.

But the food was the real star of the show; I had the Vegetable Curry - which was excellent. My son and daughter-in-law thoroughly enjoyed their choices too.

The soda bread (which I believe they make themselves) was by far the best we‚Äôve had during our entire trip to Ireland. And trust me when I say that we ate a lot of soda bread!

Highly recommended, and I‚Äôd advise you book in advance, as this place is always busy!"

Ordered the black pudding salad starter which was nice but the pudding a little undercooked (not crispy). Acknowledge this might be a personal preference but still.  Ordered fish cakes as a main and they were not great.  Dry and lacking seasoning. My co workers seemed happy with their mains. It's a good location but wasn't blown away with the food."

"Isaac's Restaurant",105,"Julie Schmidt",1322,"7 years ago",5,"We'd only just arrived in Cork when we decided to have dinner here; however we hand't made a reservation so we were prepared to go elsewhere if necessary. The woman who greeted us said she'd check if we could have a table, as they had several reservations and they were preparing for a massive group of teachers to arrive (celebrating the end of the school year). She walked around the entire restaurant with her seating chart, counting and calculating. We were thrilled she was able to seat us, and even with such a huge group coming, our service wasn't affected in the least. We felt very taken care of and our meal was delicious. Once those teachers did arrive, though, the decibel level rose incredibly. With brick walls, high ceilings and open areas, there's nothing to really absorb the sound. So when it's packed with an enthusiastic very large group, it can get loud. But overall I'd say it was a very pleasant dining experience, we truly appreciated getting seated without a reservation, and our meal was great. I'd go again in a heartbeat."
"Isaac's Restaurant",105,"Sascha Giese",2267,"5 years ago",4,"Fantastic steak. The meat was cooked to perfection, one of the best I ever had. Just a bit bland without any herbs or spice.

The only reason I didn't give the food 5 stars was because I found 2 bones in my Hake Fillet. I'm aware fish have bones but wherever I eat fish I expect no bones. Its just a personal thing.
We really enjoyed our meal here and we will return.
Well done to all involved."

"Miyazaki Japanese Take Away",108,"Darren Leung",643,"2 months ago",5,"Easily the best Japanese I've had in Ireland. Fantastic katsu don. Proper ratios of authentic, delicate flavors using tasty ingredients that taste the part as much as they look it (unlike so many other shops with notions). Grab your food and go around the corner to eat at the free Elizabeth Fort's picnic tables, instead. I suppose if I'd ding anything it would be the very un-Japanese demeanor of kitchen staff, but what can you do, this isn't Japan lol. Also, wish there was a more environmentally friendly option for this kind of takeaway."
"Miyazaki Japanese Take Away",108,"Dusel Dusel",751,"a month ago",5,"The grilled fish has a tender texture that creates a delightful melting effect when eaten, providing a rich and flavorful experience.. Authentic Japanese cuisine is a must-try. Tonkatsu is fine but nothing special. Portion is huge."
"Miyazaki Japanese Take Away",108,"YJ H",2634,"5 months ago",3,"Is it worth the hype?

The Ten Don which the sauce should be served separately from the dish, instead of doing this, they poured the sauce in the dish and it makes everything SOGGY. I think it ruined the Ten Don.

The ramen tasted bad‚Ä¶ feels like ordering a ‚Ç¨17.6 instant noodles, DO NOT ODER this."
"Miyazaki Japanese Take Away",108,"Mirin Mooney",1805,"4 months ago",5,"One of my total favourite restaurants/ take-aways in cork. Every dish is always so delicious with such unique flavours. It‚Äôs small so you never know if you‚Äôll be able to sit, but I‚Äôm always happy to get takeaway instead - so delicious. The aged dashi tofu is my favourite!"
"Miyazaki Japanese Take Away",108,"Ajumi H",92,"8 months ago",5,"Came here together with my friend and partner and we ordered three different dishes.

I ordered the January special (Kimchi Porkbelly Ricebowl with natto and soft boiled egg). It was a very generous portion size and super tasty. I personally LOVE natto, that‚Äôs why I wished there was a bit more natto. I think it was just a teaspoon or less (but maybe it‚Äôs because Irish people are not used to the taste).

My partner ordered a Karaage Don which was our personal highlight! So so good. Super crunchy and juicy and the spices were just perfect.

My Japanese friend ordered Udon and paid extra for Natto and unfortunately this is the only dish we cannot recommend. The portion size was surprisingly quite small for the price and also the noodles texture was not great. Also, she paid 2‚Ç¨ extra for natto (on request) but got only a small teaspoon on top of her bowl. That was a little bit disappointing.
The soup base was very delicious, though.

Overall I still rate this place with five stars with the hope that there will be some changes for the Udon dish and to highlight their great rice bowls!
Will definitely come back again next time when I‚Äôm in cork :)"

"Ross Bakery & Caf√©",109,"Mr Farrell",1828,"Edited a year ago",5,"Ross Bakery & Caf√© is an absolute gem, lads. I popped in for the first time while I was grafting away and let me tell ya, the selection of cakes and breads was amazing! I ended up grabbing two of them and had to use all my willpower not to demolish them in the car on the way home. The smell alone was enough to make me mill into half cake, lads. If you're a fan of a good sweet treat like me, this place is a must-visit.

I also grabbed a bottle of coke while I was at it, ya know. And  the staff, proper sound folks, even at the crack of dawn. Full of craic and smiles, which was a nice change for that early in the morning. Trust me, this spot is well worth a visit if you're in the mood for some next level baked goods and a bit of a laugh. Cheers to Ross Bakery & Caf√© for a deadly experience!"

The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making us feel right at home. I thoroughly enjoyed the grilled cheese and ham sandwich, which was perfectly toasted and filled with grilled cheese and savoury ham. My wife loved her vegetarian Irish breakfast with a variety of fresh ingredients and a good brewed coffee.

We also indulged in a delicious rhubarb tart to go, which we purchased from the bakery section of the caf√©. The tart was flaky, sweet, and tangy, the perfect ending to our meal. The caf√© itself has a cosy and inviting atmosphere, with comfortable seating. Overall, Ross Bakery & Caf√© is a fantastic spot for a delicious meal and a relaxing atmosphere. I highly recommend it!"

For those of us under 40, this is the stuff our grannies used to make! Really nostalgic, traditional and well-presented bakes. Their ring doughnuts and coffee cake are a particular favourite of mine.

Service is friendly and efficient too!

Some of these reviews are complaining about price. These people must not get out much! For locally made baking, fresh from the kitchen to your mouth, the prices are very reasonable. I always expect to pay more and leave with plenty of change for really good breads, cakes and buns. It all tastes so well made too, you‚Äôd pay twice the amount for mass produced and low quality nonsense at a big chain caf√©."

An hour and half passed and nothing, so I called them. They did not even know I had ordered. Asked me for Eircode etc and then said oh we can see your order, it will be another 40 minutes. This place is 5 minutes walk away for context. But I am home with 2 small kids so cannot leave. Basically they hadn't even started our order so I asked for a refund. I was told couldn't be done and he'd have to call the owners. Absolutely shocking. It's now 9pm and will have to order from someone else. I have 2 kids with autism who will likely start waking up soon. I may not get to eat now. And I'll be out 50euro because they don't seem to do refunds!"

I love thin pizza, but this was crazy. Every time I tried to pick up a slice it would crumble into pieces.  Maybe it was just a bad night. Had Novacento's years ago and it was delicious, so who knows."

I came back several times with good friends and colleagues, when visiting Cork. It always feels like coming Home.
He offers the three stouts: Murphy's, Beamish and Guinness, different Whiskeys and all you need to drink in a good Pub.
I prefer Murphy's and Black Bush ;-)
Slainte Eugene, see you next time.
Greetings from Germany ! Frank"

The owner(Eugene) was a nice guy, and I talked with another older fellow whose name I've sadly forgotten. Eugene told me a few stories, like his time at Niagara Falls. Not sure if he'd remember me, I was there back in September 2019. I was the young Canadian fellow with the big backpack who ordered a Murphy's Stout. Your Bar was a real treat, and it was a great way to finish my time in Cork!"

"St Lukes Wine Tavern",112,"Alan O'Brien",105,"Edited a month ago",4,"A real gem in the hills of Cork.

The only reason this isn't 5 star is the mad price for the tapas and the boards!

That being said, we opted instead for the special which was the best smash burger I've ever had, and a side of incredible potato's. The price for the special was very reasonable and the food was exceptional!

Everything else was amazing. The food was so so good and the vibes of the restaurant were great! The staff were friendly and attentive and I would highly recommend the place."

"St Lukes Wine Tavern",112,"David Anderson",655,"2 years ago",5,"A lovely neighborhood shop at the St. Luke's crossing intersection just north and above the old town area. Service was excellent, the food was delicious and just right portions, and the value was great. Had the roasted almonds ( nice smoky spice maybe mix of cumin and paprika?) And olive oil marinated mixed olives, split a tasty crispy thin crust pizza, and had the patatas braves (take or leave the sauce, but the potatoes were perfectly crispy outside and hot inside). And the dessert was also good. But most of all the smiling and sunny service, the lovely outdoor seating, and the generous wine pour made this place a treat after a day of sightseeing."

"Umi Falafel Cork",113,"Ailish Heffernan",79,"a month ago",5,"I recently had a craving for Middle Eastern food after spending some time living abroad in that part of the world. When I arrived, I was warmly greeted by Hassan, who patiently indulged me as I dusted off my rusty Arabic. We had wonderful chats about his home country of Lebanon and all the beautiful places there.

For lunch, I ordered the Fattoush Salad (gluten-free) and Hummus, served with gluten-free bread. Both dishes were fresh, flavourful, and absolutely delicious. The hummus portion was so generous that I happily took the rest home.

The atmosphere was lovely ‚Äî I sat outside in the sunshine, enjoying my lunch and the relaxed vibe. This place offers great value for money, warm hospitality, and mouthwatering food. Mashallah! I‚Äôll definitely be back, inshallah. Shukran to Hassan and the whole team. A tonic for the souls who are looking for some authentic Middle Eastern cuisine."

"Umi Falafel Cork",113,"ieyla fadzil",1073,"4 months ago",4,"Visited this restaurant quite a while ago, but still remember the experience. We tried falafel without really knowing what it was at the time ‚Äî our first impression was that the taste was a bit bland, especially for an Asian palate. It felt more like eating healthy food than something flavourful.

The restaurant itself was quite small and crowded, which made the dining experience a bit less comfortable.

Overall, it was an interesting experience, but not something we‚Äôd rush back for."
"Umi Falafel Cork",113,"Bridget",385,"4 months ago",1,"Absolute ripoff - I would be ashamed to serve what I got today if I owned a restaurant. The shawarma sandwich I ordered was adding 1,50‚Ç¨ to the meal price (which is already pretty expensive since everything is plant-based, and the only drinks included in the meal are basic cans and bottles) and it was literally a flat piece of bread with only salad, a sliced tomato, and 3 pieces of mushroom drowned in sauce. Disgraceful - leaving a photo of what it looked like once the tomato was removed. I don‚Äôt remember the last time eating out left me so disappointed and angry, I strongly advise against eating there."

"Mutton Lane Inn",114,"John Mee",1263,"2 months ago",5,"Went here after a recommendation from a friend. Very chilled out and a great atmosphere. Reminds me of my favourite pub from years ago. The first night we were there, the music consisted of Joy Division, Nirvana and Pink Floyd. In my book it doesn't get better than that. Nice mix of people there too. I'd definitely go back, and you should too. Oh, and by the way, the staff are super friendly. Tell them I send ya! ;-)"

"Mutton Lane Inn",114,"Mike Letchford",1795,"a month ago",5,"Great little pub extended with clever use of the narrow lane, that has awesome artwork murals. Friendly staff and locals, managed to snag a Guinness and learnt about the more local stouts of Beamish and Murphy's too."

I was aware of the hype around this pub, and so decided to call in on a Saturday afternoon when I was out and about. Despite being a quieter part of the day, it was still lively and a great place to pop in for a pint. Top atmosphere, decor and barman. I'm sure it gets a lot rowdier at night and I'll hopefully make it back to see that for myself, but regardless, don't be afraid to stick your head in for a swift one or two if you're nearby during the day, you can't go wrong."

"Three Fools Coffee Douglas",115,"Kevin Byrne",1413,"2 months ago",5,"The Three Fools Coffee crew take their coffee seriously.  The previous cafe at this location didn't take its coffee as seriously and the jump in coffee quality is evident. I ordered a cappuccino and everything was right, the temperature,  the flavour,  and the milk consistency.  So much so that I went and ordered a second one! The redesign of the cafe is well thought out, leaving room for people to walk through without a clutter of tables. It has clean lines. I like the ""hole in the wall"" service counter also, allowing passing trade for shoppers without clogging up the main counter. There is an impressive array of the latest coffee brewing technology on display behind the counter. It's satisfying also that The Three Fools is a local enterprise set up in 2015, so it feels like it supports the local economy in a sense to ""shop local"". Definitely will be back when in the area."

The gentleman working at the bar said you can have dinner here but people could be reaching over you , etc. There was NOONE at the bar mind you.   He suggests we sit at a bar table.  We did.. and we waited and waited and no one came by.  We had to ask for a menu.  We got one and then waited more. I suggested to my Husband to leave for the reasons listed above and also the hostess and other waitresses were shunning us.  They were talking about us it was very clearly noticed.

"Panorama Bistro & Terrace",116,"Justin Mattina",1328,"4 weeks ago",3,"The ambience here is excellent and the potential to be really great is here but the quality is just not there. I ate here two nights in a row and while the view is spectacular the food quality is just not there. The first night I had the strip loin steak and while that was delicious the sides were just meh and nothing remarkable. Tonight I ordered the halibut and asparagus and while that was delicious the potatoes were bland and flavourless. I tried both the ‚Äúnew‚Äù potatoes as well as the ‚Äúskinny‚Äù fries and both were just meh. I suppose the ambience makes up for a lot but imagine if everything was delicious and you could have the ambience. I am a guest at the hotel and I also had breakfast here and it was not great. It was super slow to be seated and the buffet was not replenished and service was just slow. This is an example of way to busy and not enough staff which is a management problem. For such a great property they could do better."

The dining room provided a peaceful atmosphere, conducive to a pleasant conversation. Unfortunately, my experience was marred by slow and inconsistent service, possibly due to the restaurant being understaffed. I found the server to be efficient yet rushed, and the food took longer than expected to arrive at the table. To make matters worse, one of our dishes never came, yet we were still charged for it. While the prices were steep, the service did not meet my expectations. Overall, the stunning views and well-designed space may make up for shortcomings in service, but at these prices, we expected more."
"Panorama Bistro & Terrace",116,"Trish Lambert",2544,"3 years ago",5,"We ate here recently while staying in the Montenotte Hotel and it was a lovely evening.

"Panorama Bistro & Terrace",116,"Gabs G.",917,"2 years ago",4,"Panorama Bistro Terrace at the Montenotte Hotel is an absolute gem for any food lover out there. As someone who has visited here twice now, I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of food and the impeccable service provided by the staff.

To begin with, the food is simply divine. Every bite is filled with an explosion of flavors that will leave you wanting more. The only minor drawback is that the food may take some time to arrive, but trust me, it's well worth the wait.

What stood out to me the most was the fact that we asked for a baby bowl for our 6-month-old. It's often hard to find restaurants that cater to the needs of parents with young children, so this was a pleasant surprise.

The staff was accommodating and friendly, and order times stopped to chat when they heard that I spoke Spanish to my baby. You could tell they genuinely cared about making our dining experience a memorable one. The outdoor seating area that offers breathtaking views of Cork city and was packed with people enjoying the lovely weather.

Last but not least, I have to give a shoutout to the friendly bunch of Spanish staff who stopped and had a chat with us. They made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived."

"Nectar Coffee",118,"Renee Cutaia",2110,"2 years ago",5,"Nice coffee shop. Good quality beans, good blending, reasonable price. Normally we only go for coffee but they do have a few snacks that always look tasty. We keep coming back for the coffee because it has such a good balance of flavour (not to bitter). The shop is small but usually service is pretty fast so no issues to get in and out in a reasonable amount of time."

"The Bookshelf at The Elysian",119,"Andrew Pope",201,"a year ago",4,"We arrived at the end of a busy Sunday service. It was a bit hectic with lots of items missing off the menu. I don't think this is the usual experience so I'll need to visit again to compare. Nonetheless, the food was really good. We ordered the breakfast bap and the avocado and toast. The avocado and eggs in particular was great. The addition of the peanut and sesame rayu made it extra special (we even bought a jar when we were leaving)."

We ordered two scones, a hot chocolate, and tea‚Äîall delicious. Service was impressively fast. The tea came with a pot and cup, and the scones were served with butter and jam, which added to the flavor. The atmosphere was wonderful. For 3 scones, 1 hot chocolate, and 1 tea, I paid ‚Ç¨17.30, which felt fair for the quality. The place is across to City Hall Q-Park if you need a parking space."

The Beamish did not disappoint, nor did the toasties.  But the best part of our stop was the excellent service provided by Tony.   He is the consummate bartender.

If we find ourselves back in Cork in the future, we will be stopping in at Fordes Bar, for sure!"

First time i came here food was great, the second and third time i came it was absolutely disgusting! (wanted to try it again as i thought it would be as good as the first time)
both times, they messed up our orders!
i ordered pancakes with compot- they gave me pancakes with bacon, when i addresssd the issue they just took the pancakes in the back and brought out the same pancakes just took the bacon off and added the compot on top!it was misserable!
also ordered an iced mocha and it was not drinkable! the chocolate was all sank at the bottom and wasnt melted with the coffee, it had bits of chocolate floating around!
my eggs benedict came out with a bit of bacon and 2 eggs on a piece of bread, it had no rocket or garnish or anything- it looked dead!
i am very dissapointed with everything- for the price of ‚Ç¨60+ i expect them at least to know how to make a presentable plate and a decent iced mocha!
Absolute RIPP offf !! will never return and will never recomend to anyone!"

The exterior always caught my attention, as it is very beautiful and well decorated. For my birthday, I decided to make a reservation and... I couldn't have chosen better! üçª

You have plenty of options on the menu. We opted for the Avo & Eggs, which was exquisite. If you order it, be aware that the Rayu is spicy; you can request it on the side if spice isn't your thing. We also ordered the Korean Chicken Burger‚Äîlooks spectacular, tastes even better.

The service was super friendly. Before leaving, Mark thanked us for choosing the restaurant and invited us to come back. We'll definitely return! Thank you very much ‚ú®üòä"

No parmesan or pepper, pancetta was definitely not in it either. Crazy l that they wanted 12 euros for it."
"Cafeteria Tiramisu",120,"Travis Life",2537,"10 months ago",5,"Pleasantly surprised. Continental Europe in the heart of Cork. Hurriedly passed Tiramisu many times but always sensed good vibes.

My husband never misses the chance to say how much he LOVES the cappuccino. Our 2-year-old son eats an entire plate by himself (generous portions!) and they always bring coloring pages and crayons to keep him entertained.

We especially enjoy going on Sunday mornings when it‚Äôs not too crowded. The traditional Irish breakfast is absolutely delicious ‚Äî we highly recommend it!"
"Tony's Bistro",122,"Robert Schuppert-McDonald",2149,"Edited 7 months ago",4,"Ordered breakfast served in a hot skillet and it came with coffee or tea.

"The Saucy Cow Vegan Food Cork",123,"Van N.",2565,"a year ago",4,"I went to Marina Market today and found this vegan place, fortunately has good options, few burgers, bowls and chips. Service was nice and fast. I got the Space burguer with chips, it was a little spicy, just as I was looking for."

Everything is vegan and so good, we got 3 burgers, tofu, Caesar salad, and avocado crema hashbrows. The tofu was one of the best things I ever put in my gob, and the buffalo burger was top notch!

"The Saucy Cow Vegan Food Cork",123,"Cameron Rossi",413,"a year ago",4,"Good VEGAN lunch today, nothing spectacular, but filing. The ladies were super friendly and proficient. We found out after we arrived that the mushroom burger (the only thing we really wanted) was only available the Dublin location which was a bummer because we can get Beyond in the states (oh well) everyone and their mother has Beyond or Impossible. Well, at least there were some vegan restaurants in Ireland.
Oh. The wife left the pager they gave us in her jacket, we found out hours away. Guess we can mail it back to you, or something."
"The Saucy Cow Vegan Food Cork",123,"Jen O'M",1190,"a week ago",3,"I went here recently with my teenager who is vegan. There was noone in the stall so we came back roughly 10minute later to order. One worker was on her phone and the other was sitting down, neither showing interest in serving us.

We looked over the menu and I went to order for my son as neither gave him the curtesy to ask what he would like to order while he stood looking in clearly ready to order.

I proceed to go up and order and pay for him. He ordered a burger that was ‚Ç¨12.50. I got charged ‚Ç¨15.00.!
I asked the girl why she charged me ‚Ç¨15.00 when it stated clearly ‚Ç¨12.50 on the board.
She told me she added a ‚Ç¨2.50 tip.! Then continued to giggle it off..

Should a tip not be at our own discretion?
I did not want to make a scene but found it rude to say the least. We watched as the burger was then prepared by the girl who was on her phone the whole time while she made it..

For the girl who decided on on her own accord to add a tip after the service was nothing but ignorant and appalling was nothing but living up to their name and SAUCY!"
"The Saucy Cow Vegan Food Cork",123,"Mateusz Altman",1699,"2 years ago",5,"The burgers are solid, nothing groundbreaking but very good nevertheless. The hash browns are the fire tho. Spicy and hot and juicy. Remember to take napkins as buns are on a messy side."

After waiting over 10 minutes to order, the couple turned around to tell me 'if you're waiting to order they're closed now' one of the staff members laughed while the other said sorry.

I had arrived 15mins before closing and I understand people wanting to get out of work quickly but the staff could tell me they're no longer taking orders so I could go elsewhere instead of ignoring me and chatting away to their friends.

Disappointing. Wouldn't go back."

"Dennehy's Bar",124,"Thomas Thornton",2487,"Edited 2 years ago",5,"Dennehy's Bar is a brilliant local pub in the middle of the city!
The owners and staff are friendly, attentive and most of all welcoming!
They have a lovely selection of beer on tap however, I came in for a pint of stout.
They serve a delicious pint of Guinness here and I can't imagine that any of the other stouts would be any different!

Layout:
The layout of the bar is split into two rooms. The first room is in the front and surrounds the bar itself with some seating. The second room has more seating and is to the rear of the premises.
There is a small amount of seating out front of the bar which is lovely on a nice sunny day to enjoy a cold drink.

Decor:
The pub is decorated with memorabilia from Cork City's history through maps and photographs of the people as well as little plaques with historic details, etc.
There is an old fire place in the room to the back of the bar. It was the third of June when we visited and it was covered up so I am not sure if it is still in use. Maybe we'll visit again when the weather gets colder and see if the fire place is in use then!
I didn't notice any tv other than an old antique tv. The feel of this is a bar is one of a place where people should come for conversation rather than come to watch tv!

Overall Opinion:
Dennehy's Bar is an old school bar with a timely feel to it! Things feel like they move a little slower here and its wonderful!
I highly recommend stopping by Dennehy's Bar for a beautiful pint of Guinness or drink of your choosing and have a good auld chat with friends!"
"Dennehy's Bar",124,"Stephen McCormack",2394,"4 months ago",1,"Arrived in for a drink after dinner on Saturday in Cornstore (highly recommend). Had a pint of Guinness each and sat at the end of the bar. At 12.29 we asked for a final pint. Young barman told us the bar was closed. We were a bit shocked but took it on the chin. 5 or 6 mins later, 4  people walked in and ordered a drink. The barman served them. We asked why they were served and not us, to which he responded 'they have just come from a restaurant across the road'. We said we had just come from the same, to which we were told 'I don't need to explain myself to you'.

Tbh, felt discriminated against because we didn't have a local accent.

Will not go here again unfortunately. Will not recommend."

We went for dinner and shared some sushi, rolls, and the miso soup. Everything was fresh and tasty, not too fancy but done really well. The staff were friendly and chill, just the right amount of attention.

It‚Äôs a great place if you want good Japanese food without it being too formal. Not super cheap, but fair for what you get. I‚Äôd definitely go again."

The atmosphere is very pleasant and they have a very wonderful staff and that‚Äôs the only reason why I‚Äôm giving a three rating rather than a one. I was very disappointed with the food that they served. It just looks nice but the taste is terrible. It felt that the person cooking it did not like what they are doing. The miso soup is fishy, the rice is not freshly prepared. It tastes like it was prepared yesterday and was just served to us. The rice was not even warm when it was served. The beef teriyaki seems to be heated from a microwave and the chef sushi could not even  be called a ‚Äúchef sushi‚Äù. The salmon also tastes like it was cooked in the morning and just reheated. I did not feel any freshness at all in the food preparation. This was one of the places I was looking forward to visit but it was a very disappointing experience. All that wonderful customer service and great ambiance only to be ruined by the food served."

"The Fountain Pub",126,"Antonia Shine",251,"a week ago",1,"Yesterday my friend decided to go into the pub. We explained to the manager at the door that my children had autism and she said it‚Äôs okay they can come in. She never said anything about them running around or anything then we explained to them that they cannot sit down for a long time she was okay with that but then after some time after we had some time together with my friends, she decided that that we cannot stay because the kids are moving around and that we had to leave which was a disgrace. The children have autism and they don‚Äôt understand. This is not a child friendly pub so please do not bring your children there. Thanks.  Very disappointed with the service I got here."

We were very warmly welcomed, and promptly served; our waiting staff could not have been nicer.

Food was incredible (though I still need to try the desserts), good sized portions, teas and lasso were delicious, staff was very fast and friendly, and the whole restaurant itself is well kept, tidy and pretty

Honestly, I don't think it has any flaws? Maybe just that the toilets are a bit simple? They're functional and clean... But yeah just felt like the bathrooms were an afterthought. But other than that, this is a definite must go for curry lovers and Nepali/Indian food enjoyers!"

"Thali Nepal Restaurant",127,"Wayne Phair",2599,"a month ago",5,"We visited this Nepalese restaurant on a recommendation, and it did not disappoint! The food was absolutely delicious and felt truly authentic. We tried the butter chicken and chicken balti with pilau rice, and each dish was bursting with rich, layered flavors. The butter chicken was creamy and perfectly spiced, while the balti had just the right kick without being overpowering. The pilau rice was fragrant and paired beautifully with both dishes.

The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, and the service was attentive without being intrusive. You can really taste the care that goes into the cooking here.

If you‚Äôre looking for authentic, flavorful Nepalese cuisine, this is definitely a place worth visiting. We went on a friend‚Äôs recommendation and would highly recommend it ourselves!"

From the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel both welcome and cared for, with warm hospitality and flawless service. Each course was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor‚Äîcreative yet comforting, with the kind of attention to detail that makes every bite memorable.

The atmosphere was intimate and elegant without being pretentious, which allowed us to fully relax and savor the evening. It was clear why The Glass Curtain has earned its Michelin star- it exceeded every expectation. This meal was a highlight of our trip, and we will absolutely return when we are back in Ireland."

"The Glass Curtain",128,"Jim Morrall",1223,"a week ago",5,"What a wonderful first night in Cork!

Evelien really looked after us; what great craic, great knowledge and she helped us tailor the menu to our dietary needs. I was a bit freaked out to discover the wine pairing would be mostly natural wines which aren‚Äôt usually my fave - but she knows her stuff and has a lot of great choice. I really enjoyed all the wines in the end, even loved that she found a way to charm me into the natural wine movement lol.

And the meal was sensational. So many beautiful ingredients, the freshest of seafood and produce. Everything cooked so skilfully and delicately, and some flavour and texture combos that will stay with me (in particular the smoked tomatoes with the lobster ü§§). We did the tasting menu and got the lobster extra - so glad we got to try it. Everything came out looking amazing, and the staff were really good at telling us all about each dish. Sometimes that kinda service level can feel a bit pretentious but here it just comes across that they love why they do.

And the chef came to say hi for dessert which was a lovely touch. Seems a genuinely nice bloke.

I have literally no constructive criticism for these guys - bunch of total legends. Love what you do."

"Box'd! Drive Thru Coffee",130,"stephen o sullivan",2399,"4 months ago",2,"It's honestly very disappointing to have to leave a 2 star review here - Have been a regular customer (actually 2 of us in the car..) for months, coming probably 4 times minimum per week. Have recommended the place to countless friends. But lately the standard has dropped - last 3 occasions the coffees both hot and iced have been bland by previous standards.

However the most frustrating part (and also a kick in the teeth) is that the squid loyalty which was already at 10 coffees (much higher than competitor's including bean and leaf who are right down the street and only require 7) is now increased to 12! How the management think that 12 coffees to earn one free is acceptable is outrageous - you're only affecting those who were loyal and supported you early on in the first place. Out of principle you'll be losing our custom"
"Box'd! Drive Thru Coffee",130,"N P",1839,"6 months ago",2,"I‚Äôm a loyal customer of BOXD and always make a point to bring friends along every week. I also recommend it to everyone I can, always saying it‚Äôs the best coffee spot in Cork. However, I had a disappointing experience today.

I ordered a Pistachio Latte, and after taking the first sip, I found the coffee flavor quite strong. So, I politely asked if it would be possible to add a little more pistachio. The barista (a girl who was wearing an all-green outfit) was extremely rude and immediately refused, saying that she had already added 1.5 pumps and that if I wanted more, I‚Äôd have to pay. The issue wasn‚Äôt the rule itself but the way she spoke to me‚Äîso harshly that I was left speechless.

Thankfully, another barista, who was very kind, pointed out that I had redeemed my drink using my loyalty points (ironically), and she mentioned that she could add more pistachio without charging me. However, the first barista did so very unwillingly, and I left feeling incredibly frustrated. To make things worse, I ended up feeling unwell after drinking the coffee.

I know this is not the usual BOXD experience (or at least I hope it isn‚Äôt), but this situation made me hesitant to return. I truly hope this feedback is helpful because no one deserves to be treated this way. What should have been a moment to relax and enjoy my coffee turned into an uncomfortable and embarrassing experience."

27-July-2025 Update:
My wife and I called in as we were nearby and said its been a minute since we were here.
The bar hasn't changed much if at all and the staff as as friendly as ever!
I got one of the local Cork beers Original 7 Larger and my wife got a Murphy's stout and we took in the fine weather out the back in the beer garden.

Food:
The pizzas here are delicious! I highly recommend stopping by for a pizza and mach use of the pizza and a pint deal!
We got a spicey salami pizza and a garlic and tomato sauce pizza while we were here. Both were amazing and we were surprised by the garlic pizza as we didn't realise it didn't have cheese but it was perfectly delicious!

Old Review:
There is loads of space to choose from be it the small bar at the front, the back room by the fire, the side bar by the beer garden and last but not least, the fantastic beer garden out the back! Any area you choose will be great!
It can be very busy at weekends but come here early or mid week if you are looking for something a little quieter!
Over the years I've spent many a Friday or Saturday evening catching up with friends and its always been a great location!
The beer garden is my favourite spot in this bar and they have their own pizza kitchen in the back garden as well.
Definitely check out Tom Barry's, you won't be disappointed!"

The outdoor seating area is ideal for summers.
The food is super delicious and their perfect thin crust pizzas have an amazing texture.
Our personal favourite pizza is FRIDA with its mixture of ham, cherry tomatoes, mozzarella and rockets.

What a great choice and value for money. The side mixed vegetable soup was delicious and filling the tastes of the Carrots Potatoes and turnip blended well together. Once again great value for money visited at lunch time.

The toasted sandwich was beautifully cooked filling and the ingredients used were bursting throughout. The relish and cheese perfect with the ham and also a little side order of Coleslaw. But the mixed Carrot soup was outstanding. The best value and tasty toasted sandwich I have tried so far. In these tough times it was greatly enjoyed.

"Bocelli Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar",134,"Maryia V.",1693,"a month ago",5,"We had a very good overall experience at this restaurant. There were six of us, and while we were told we needed to wait for our table to be prepared, which took a bit of time, everything after that went smoothly. We placed quite a large order, and all the dishes arrived promptly.

Everything was tasty, and everyone at our table praised their meals. Personally, I feel I didn‚Äôt make the best choice, I ordered salmon, and it was a bit overcooked and slightly tough, and also completely unsalted, which made it less enjoyable for me. However, the side dish that came with it was absolutely delicious.

One of my friends mentioned that her perch was slightly overcooked, but apart from that, everyone else said their food was truly amazing. Considering the number of dishes we ordered, these are really minor remarks.

The desserts were especially praised, we ordered a selection, and my friends were delighted (I didn‚Äôt try them myself, so I can‚Äôt comment firsthand). The coffee was excellent."
"Bocelli Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar",134,"Lori K",1538,"a month ago",5,"We came here after we couldn't get in somewhere else because we didn't have reservations. I was happy we were able to get in here and even happier after we ate! It was amazing! The pasta was excellent, steak cooked perfectly, and the dessert was to die for! Everything was excellent and the service was great. I thought they were fast, efficient and very attentive. I am so glad we were able to try this little gem!"
"Bocelli Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar",134,"Mary Nolan",1688,"2 months ago",5,"The food was absolutely fantastic it was like being back in Italy.  Definitely 10/10, the staff were fantastic, we were celebrating an anniversary and they brought out a dessert with a candle such a lovely gesture.  Would highly recommend bocelli's and cant wait to go back."
"Bocelli Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar",134,"Steve Callahan",2402,"4 months ago",5,"This place was quite the pleasant surprise.  The food is high quality and the service was over the top. We were quite needy and had many requests (such as switching tables from outside to inside when it got too cold) and the servers met every need with a great attitude. Everyone enjoyed their meal. If you like well prepared Italian with great service then this is the place."
"Bocelli Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar",134,"PH",2038,"10 months ago",1,"AVOID! Honestly, this place was so disappointing. First off, the staff completely ignored us on multiple occasions and would walk away even after looking directly at our table. I understand they are busy but having us change tables after already seating us just because they need more seating was terribly rude!

We were hoping the food would make up for it but it didn't! The portion sizes are tiny and the dishes in general are so bland! I got a cream based pasta and there was very little cream. I could literally make the same thing at home. NOT worth 20 euro. Also very inconsistent, some of us who ordered the same thing got it with garnish and cheese on top while others didn't have it at all! The garlic bread is literally just pitta with garlic sauce. We left feeling hungry and disappointed."
"Bocelli Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar",134,"Mateusz Altman",1699,"3 months ago",4,"Place is generally fairly okay, the food is decent;  focaccia was a highlight. However even tho they advertise catering for various dietary needs, staff has no clue about that. Also in the menu items that has no mil as an alergen are being served with Parmesan on top."
"Bocelli Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar",134,"Farida Salim",864,"6 months ago",4,"Good food but smaller portions, good atmosphere and friendly staff.
Got my order wrong and it was rectified within 7-8 minutes and was obviously made fresh.
Do recommend for date night though I went for a birthday dinner. Excellent all around!"

"Bocelli Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar",134,"Thomas",2475,"5 months ago",5,"Nice environment, absolutely perfect, my wife was absolutely satisfied with the steak, I had a pizza, it was great. Soft dough, excellent garnish, definitely recommend. And for dessert we definitely recommend tiramisu."
"Bocelli Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar",134,"Vjatseslav Sakovits",2590,"2 months ago",5,"I was surprised how good the italian food actually was. I‚Äôve had chill burrata and pasta carbonara. I liked it very much and my friend(who has lived in Italy for 30 years was also impressed (and believe me, it‚Äôs not easy to impress him with italian foodüòÄ) so highly reccomend!"
"Paladar",135,"Jessica Sandstrom",1214,"4 months ago",5,"What an absolutely fantastic experience. We sat at the bar and Adam our bartender was incredible. He helped us with great recommendations and every cocktail was perfect. I would definitely recommend making a reservation because it gets busy. We had the cabbage, guacamole, and cheese sandwiches and they were delicious."
"Brick Lane",170,"Kevin McCabe",1426,"a year ago",4,"Loved the atmosphere here and a typical variety of beers at the bar. There is some outdoor seating that is covered (a rarity in Ireland). The food was alright, but left a little something to be desired. Service was pleasant. I would return, but probably more for drinks than for food. The music was a good volume and again, enjoyed the atmosphere."
"Paladar",135,"Jemima Daisy",1187,"3 weeks ago",5,"Everything about this spot was perfect!

We hadn't booked so got a small bar stool table which was still comfortable. We ordered 5 of small plates and the pork tacos to share.
My cocktail was incredible and well explained by the server who was enthusiastic, friendly and well versed.
The market fish tostadas were our stand out dish, but the rest of the dishes were also very good. My only slight criticism would be that I wanted a little more spice - but that's personal preference!

Really enjoyable and highly recommend! We might be back!"
"Tedo Tapas Bar",148,"Cora Keogh",565,"3 months ago",4,"The sangria is good! We didn‚Äôt try any of the food just went for drinks and the vibes were good"
"Paladar",135,"Cormac Wyatt",570,"3 months ago",5,"OMG, what can I say about Paladar other than AMAZING! Walking in, the decor, vibe and attention to detail is second to none. The host Gustavo is a special talent that's hard to come by. Friendly while trying to deal with a thousand things at once. Quick in his actions but delicate in how he works. We came at a busy time and had to wait for a seat but had a drink while waiting. And then there's the drinks!! The cocktails were glorious. You could also see at the bar how good they were at making them, the attention and skill involved. Adam particularly was really friendly and showed his ability at making a good drink. Can't rate this place higher. Must go to while in Cork!"
"Paladar",135,"Sean Gorman",2290,"4 months ago",5,"Fantastic spot for a classy, well made cocktail. The vibes are immaculate and transport you far away from Rainy Ireland to a warmer Latin haven. The Bartender knew their business and walked us through picking our perfect cocktails for the evening. Prices are reasonable and straightforward. Sad the kitchen was already closed so we were unable to try their selection of tapas."
"Paladar",135,"Romain Balducci",2167,"a month ago",5,"Excellent place!! Absolutely loved the theme! Staff was super nice, cocktails and food were delicious!! Definitely worth a visit!"
"Paladar",135,"Bridget Fahey",386,"a week ago",5,"Wonderful cocktails, great music and ambience, and I cannot say enough good things about the people that work here. I celebrated my 30th birthday AND engagement here, and my fianc√©e and I were shown such incredible hospitality by everyone we interacted with. I wish I could remember our bartender‚Äôs name, he truly made the night special. It‚Äôs been a month since we returned from Ireland, and our night at Paladar is one of our favorite memories from the whole trip. Highly recommend spending your time and money here!"
"Paladar",135,"Colin Jones",544,"5 months ago",4,"Very busy bar, well it was a Saturday night. Interesting queuing  system to ensure everyone waits there turn to find a table.
Well kept pint of Beamish, house Malbec was distinctly ropey though.
Cocktails seemed very popular, suggest its best to book a table in advance, particularly if you would like to eat here"
"Paladar",135,"DC reviews",680,"a month ago",5,"Paladar is a South American themed tapas/cocktail bar. Has an interesting interior that's warm yet spacious. The cocktail menu while sounding interesting is surprisingly delicious. The staff were attentive and welcoming and well rounded in their cocktail skills.
Didn't have the opportunity to sample their light bites but I will definitely return to try these and many more of their delicious cocktails!!"
"Paladar",135,"JT Mauricio",1307,"a year ago",4,"Nice vibe and cool decor with a lovely team of bartenders. The cocktails are well executed but the signature ones lack some personality and the glassware could be more interesting. The food is honest to what they propose."
"Paladar",135,"Kelly Williamson",1402,"3 months ago",5,"We had such a great experience at Paladar‚Äîeverything was amazing! The food was so good I honestly can‚Äôt even pick a favorite dish.

A big shoutout to Alice, who was an absolute standout! She went above and beyond, especially with our toddler in tow‚Äîso patient, kind, and incredibly helpful. She even gave us great recommendations for the rest of our trip.

Highly recommend dining here if you‚Äôre in the area‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be disappointed!"
"Bella Napoli",136,"Steph anie",2380,"a month ago",5,"Teh food is phenomenal. We had a cheese plate as an appetizer and lasagna / the house salad as a main. Food tastes home cooked by your Italian nonna. Everything was fresh and extremely well made. Staff was super nice and looked after us well. Because of the size of the restaurant and 3 areas (smoking outside, non smoking outside and inside) there can be small wait times. All in all I definitely recommend you to dine here. It's so very worth it!"
"Bella Napoli",136,"Jessica Ellem",1210,"a month ago",5,"Excellent food. I wanted to try everything on the menu. Scallops are not to be missed. And the blood orange soda is really good. I wish we had room for dessert!"
"Bella Napoli",136,"Robert Varnado",2150,"3 months ago",5,"Very nice staff and the food was very good quality. Both me and my wife enjoyed our food and would go back. They did get very busy and had to turn away some folks so get there before dinner rush or reserve a table."
"Bella Napoli",136,"Seongkoo Lee",2305,"3 months ago",4,"Nice cozy restaurant in the center of Cork. We loved pizza and there is some ok selection of wine you can choose from. Reasonably priced.

The restaurant is quite compact but they gave us table that is enough for 6 people.

We also liked starters with prawns and scallops. The portion is also pretty big so we were full.

It was quite busy so we had to wait for the food for a while."
"Bella Napoli",136,"Eibhlin Cahalane McGibney",769,"3 months ago",3,"Excellent food, BUT... waited 10/15 for waitress to take out order, just about finished our starter and we got our mains served,  then as we were finishing, we were told we had 10 minutes left at the table and were asked to finish.  This was never mentioned to us when we sat down, that we had a limited time. No option to get dessert, we asked could we at least sit outside and finish our wine, so we did.
Despite this, the food was really good, just a pity we were rushed so much and no dessert."
"Bella Napoli",136,"William Roberts",2613,"3 weeks ago",5,"Lovely food. Both Beef croquettes and prawns very nice.

Ragu napoletano and braised short rib beef. Cant fault. Was delicious

Was suprised at price after lower than i expected"
"Bella Napoli",136,"Dazz Phelan",679,"4 months ago",5,"Some of the best Italian food I‚Äôve ever eaten. I have only eaten here twice but on both occasions I wasn‚Äôt let down. Tried the Rigatoni first time and Ravioli the second time, both were superb.
Restaurant is reasonably priced and we could walk in‚Äôs mid week with no booking at all.
Will be back here again."
"Bella Napoli",136,"laura keeley",1469,"4 months ago",5,"This is the best gluten free pasta dish I think I've had to date. It's hard to find coeliac accommodating restaurants in the city that are also appetising, especially pasta dishes. The service was fast and friendly and the dishes are very reasonably priced with good portion sizes. I would highly recommend!"
"Bella Napoli",136,"Clodagh Gaffney",538,"3 months ago",4,"I got the ragu alla genovese. They have a gluten free option, which is great as a coeliac. However, for the price of ‚Ç¨21.50 I did not find the portion to be very generous. Additionally, the ratio of meat to pasta was off in my opinion, with too much beef in the dish. However, the meal was tasty, the service was efficient and friendly, and there was a lovely atmosphere in the restaurant."
"Bella Napoli",136,"Brian Malone",379,"4 months ago",5,"The food was absolutely delicious.
This is peak Italian cuisine.
The service was superb and the atmosphere is delightful."

"The Woodford",150,"lisA fRosT",1527,"3 weeks ago",5,"The Host was very welcoming and full of charm. The Irish stew and fish and chips were flavorful. Murphy and Beeamish Beer fresh and delicious. The pub was nicely appointed. Thank you Ireland!üáÆüá™"
"The Bookshelf Coffee House",137,"Philip O'Carroll",2048,"6 months ago",3,"Basic coffee shop serving the usual mix of coffee, scones, sausage rolls etc. Table service, polite staff. Coffee is good quality. I give this 3/5 because it's relatively expensive and most of all because the seating is uncomfortable, cramped and in need of renovation. A cafe shop should be a place you are comfortable spending time in. I understand furniture needs to be robust especially in Ireland, but a couple of cushions would make a big difference."
"The Bookshelf Coffee House",137,"Nate ON8 Productions",1858,"7 years ago",5,"I sincerely value the Bookshelf. The Bookshelf in of itself is a bit of a rebel. They buy German roasted beans from the Barn. Their espresso machine ""The Black Eagle,"" makes a consistent cup of coffee throughout the day. The staff do their best to insure that you have a memorable experience. Each time that I visit I am greeted with the same warm smiles and welcoming. They know that I have an espresso and that I am willing and eager to learn about coffee. Their brunches are amazing. The new renovations have really brightened up the place."
"The Bookshelf Coffee House",137,"Anne Cathrine B",229,"5 days ago",5,"Perfect place for breakfast and lunch. A very good selection of food and drink and the food was so tasty! Loved the place!"
"The Bookshelf Coffee House",137,"Eamonn Bernard",757,"2 weeks ago",1,"The cushions are dirty, the seating is dirty, the foyer into the toilets is dirty. The table was sticky.
This cafe is trying to hard to be cool and and has forgotten the basics of staff training, poor management."
"The Bookshelf Coffee House",137,"KAREN AUCOCK",1347,"4 months ago",1,"Food came out cold despite having to wait for it. The cheese in the stuffed croissant wasn‚Äôt melted and way too much pickle on. The table was dirty and when asked for it to be cleaned, the guy got a napkin and tried to wipe the stock jam off the table and left a mark. The cutlery was sticky.  The coffee was tepid so not all that enjoyable after the long wait for food. Cramped seating also."
"The Bookshelf Coffee House",137,"Paul Hughes",2014,"2 years ago",5,"Super legit third wave coffee shop. Excellent latte, delicious pastries, and kind and friendly crew.

"The Bookshelf Coffee House",137,"Lourdes Vicente Rodr√≠guez",1551,"5 years ago",5,"This restaurant is a beautiful place to eat in the heart of Cork city, either if you just want to enjoy a weekend brunch or have a nice dinner out. Their menu is extremely varied and caters for most people. And every week they have a lunch special that usually brings the taste from Asia, Thailand, China, etc to Ireland.

They have a great brunch menu with lovely homemade pancakes, omelettes, and avocado toast among other delicious choices. They have also the option to order homemade granola and porridge for take away so you can enjoy a healthy and tasteful breakfast while in the office or on your way to work. We are regular customers as we love the coffee and brunch there, but this time we wanted to try the new evening tapas menu.

We were very impressed with the selection as there were plenty options to choose from Mexican tortilla chips with Vegan dips option to garlic prawns or jackfruit burgers. For two people I would recommend to ask for 4 to 5 tapas, and that will be plenty food. You will definitely feel full. As for the desserts the photos speak for themselves, amazing. They were so lovely we didn't know if to eat them or contemplate them. The Head chef Eli has magical hands. The price is a little higher than the previous evening menu they had, but it is worthy if you want to try something different and food was beautiful.

If you want to get an idea of the food they serve, have a look at its Instagram account @thebookshelfcoffee as they are ver active there, and everything you will see it is honestly what you will find in the restaurant.

The staff is so friendly you will feel like home, and they welcome you with a smile. Always. The atmosphere is cozy and warm, perfect for a date or to enjoy a casual dinner with friends."
"The Bookshelf Coffee House",137,"Louis Tang (D4RK)",1545,"7 years ago",5,"One of my local favourites. The staff is pleasant and nice!

Ask the staff for some tips and tricks :)"
"The Bookshelf Coffee House",137,"neme",1868,"a year ago",5,"I had their coconut porridge which was INCREDIBLE. I went back for it. It is extremely filling for me, so don't underestimate it as a breakfast option. I haven't tried their other food yet (soon I hope).

Staff is nice and quick.

Cute atmosphere, no overwhelmingly loud music. I like that there is seating upstairs as well, it helps divide the noise since the place is small. This is not the best place to go open a laptop and do some work for a long time, but it is a nice place to do some reading."
"Gloria Jean's Coffees Castle St",138,"saumya mathew",2271,"a year ago",3,"A cozy yet spacious cafe with some good options for hot beverages. Tried their vanilla latte and white hot chocolate.

Price for my coffee  verses time spent there was great for me."
"Gloria Jean's Coffees Castle St",138,"Jiaan Cui",1217,"a year ago",5,"Spent an afternoon sitting in the coffee shop with friends and really liked the style of the shop and the coffee was delicious.

"Gloria Jean's Coffees Castle St",138,"Hayley Ramsey",1027,"3 months ago",5,"One of my favourite places to get my ice chillers, full of flavour. You're not waiting ages for your drink. I've only ever waited a few minutes max. They've never messed up my drink order.
I've never eaten the food, so I can't comment on that.
Very clean quite place. Choice of indoor or outdoor seating (outside for smokers/vapers.) Ashtrays provide.
Toilet available.

"Caff√® Nero",140,"ProfLais. Sarmento",2070,"3 months ago",3,"The place is comfortable, providing a good experience to have a coffee. The coffee is usually good but it varies according to the staff. However, it is disappointing being charged more without any warning. I mean it is a customer right to get to know the right price of products being purchased.  Apparently the Cork branch at Oliver Planket has forgotten about this. I bought a pack of biscuits  and I was charged 5 cents more two days ago. Today I bought a cappuccino and I was charged more 10 cents. If the price has been updated, It should be informed to customers. I would definetly appreciate to know exactly the price of products I purchase."
"Caff√® Nero",140,"Barbara Falke",305,"7 months ago",4,"I would probably come here more often as they have really nice coffee and seating and it is very central. However, it sometimes gets very busy and it seems the place could then do with more staff as you have to wait quite long for your coffee. Also and maybe as a result of the previous mentioned 'rush hours', I was told last time, they serve takeaway cups only from a certain point of the day (it was 4 or 5pm) even if you stay inside. This is kind of the reversed way of what I thought we would be heading towards with being more aware of our environment and waste. I hope this will not become too common in Cork's coffee shops and elsewhere."

I tried not to make a scene, and spoke to the barista on the side about the taste. They answered with I made it as it is in the recipe. In other words, that‚Äôs what we can offer here.

I didn‚Äôt like the experience, I would say I won‚Äôt be coming here anymore.

"Caff√® Nero",140,"Roberson Acker",2142,"a month ago",3,"The coffee was excellent ‚Äî as expected from Brazilian beans, it‚Äôs hard to go wrong with such quality. The lemon cake was delightful, perfectly balanced in flavor, and the panini de mozzarella was also very well executed. From a gastronomic point of view, everything was on point.

However, the service left much to be desired. There was a noticeable lack of warmth and attentiveness. In my five years working as a barista, I‚Äôve never seen staff so disengaged ‚Äî no greeting, no smiles, and an overall atmosphere that felt unwelcoming. I understand we all carry personal challenges, but professionalism in hospitality requires that we do not bring those burdens into our work.

There are so many people eager to work in this industry, and customers expect not only good food and coffee but also a pleasant human connection. A simple ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù and a genuine smile can elevate the entire experience and make the excellent coffee and food shine even more. With more attention to service and guest interaction, this place could truly stand out as exceptional."

Which would usually be 25.90 including the tea, on the bill the tea was now ‚Ç¨7.50 for a pot of tea. Which I think is crazy and a lot of others feel the same.

Service is exceptional as always. Regardless, won‚Äôt be back."
"Silver Key Bar & Restaurant",141,"kieran Kenneally",1438,"2 years ago",2,"Big bar with plenty of places to sit for big or small parties. Lots of nooks and crannies.
Food was OK but very overpriced. ‚Ç¨11.95 for small breakfast is just ludicrous.  The food itself was a big portion but nothing special.
Service was strange with my server calling me ""boy"" (might be a Cork thing) and second waitress wearing a full length coat tied up. It was cold in there.
Cleaner was also working while people were eating and was actually moping floors while customers were walking around which seemed a health hazzard.
Hard to give it a higher rating as owners reputation (bad) is also hard to ignore."
"Silver Key Bar & Restaurant",141,"Colm O'Donoghue",552,"3 months ago",2,"Had breakfast recently, complete rip off. Had full Irish & mini as per the menu ‚Ç¨ 15.95 & ‚Ç¨ 12.95, acceptable enough. Total bill came to over ‚Ç¨ 40.00, teas & coffee were not part of the price on the menu. I'm not surprised why restaurants are closing down with this pricing structure. People want value for money!! The breakfast was ok, nothing to write home about, mushrooms must have been on special offer as the plate was full of them. I would be slow to go back there again."
"Silver Key Bar & Restaurant",141,"Olivia McCarty",1944,"4 months ago",3,"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. The garlic bread was to die for! The toasty sandwich and fudge cake were very good. The chicken parmesean wasn't great. The service was unfortunately really lacking. We sat ourselves and got our own menus at the direction of the bar tender. We were helped by multiple waiters at the start and then didn't see anyone for close to 45 minutes. A runner would come bring food to other tables near us but rush off before we could get her attention and the waiters were no where to be found. We finally caught the runner and asked for water and cake through her. After that we were left for awhile again and couldn't get someone to bring our bill. I'm hoping they just had a big event seated somewhere far into the restaurant or something and that's why they were so absent? Not sure if I'd return."
"Costa",350,"Halit Karabina",1010,"2 weeks ago",2,"I haven‚Äôt had coffee anywhere else but Costa for a long time, but I have to say this: your team is really very amateur. Maybe it‚Äôs not their fault, but they do everything wrong. I just wanted to let you know :) If you‚Äôd like, I can help you with this free of charge :) Because this is not normal."
"Rearden's Bar",10,"Marina Bournel Bosson",1637,"6 months ago",5,"This pub is nice watch sport during middle of the day, dance at night and drink good fresh Guinness. The decoration is pretty and brings you directly to a nice atmosphere."
"The Abbot's Ale House",145,"Patrick Brennan",1993,"3 months ago",1,"First off, a little context, I'm an American-Irish dual citizen (mother and family born & raised in Dublin/Kildare). Secondly, have been living in Cork for 9 years trying hundreds of pubs and have never had this bad of an experience.

I was having a nice chat with an Irish Farmer, talking about agriculture, beef price increases, etc etc. and the owner pointed at a sign on the wall (which appears to be written by a child) and said ""No talking politics"". I replied, ""since when is agriculture and economy politics"". So off on the wrong foot from the get go.

Afterwards, there was a gap of 2 seats between myself and the Irish local and when some tourists walked into the gap to order, the owner said, ""Shh, be quiet, they're ordering"". The Irishman closed the gap by sitting next to me and we continued our farm-like banter to the dismay of- again, the owner.

Later on, a Finnish friend of mine and I were talking military subjects, and I mentioned my previous military training back in the states, which includes mock battles in the desert, gun range target practice, and receiving gun certifications. The Russian owner then absolutely lost the plot and got a fingers length away from my face and said aggressively ""Don't lie, don't lie, I served in the Russian armed forces and worked for Interpol"" to which I replied ""They didn't teach you to listen did they, I said trained with military guys and have some firearm training and certifications, never said I served, that's called stolen valour and is a felony"".

Even the Irish farmer was fed up and left the pub.

The owner also closed the pub at 10:00pm (which is illegal) due to a yellow status thunderstorm which amounted to a little drizzle for 2 hours.

In summary, you can find these unique beers at several other pubs in Cork city, (like the Bierhaus) and not have to experience the abuse , suppression of free speech, illegal closing times, and boring atmosphere of the most overrated pub in Cork city.

Is this a pub or The Gulag?"
"Silver Key Bar & Restaurant",141,"Anthony O'Regan",246,"2 weeks ago",1,"Awful service, stay away

I was my sons 22nd birthday last night so I made a reservation for 5 to celebrate. We were seated in a booth woth two tables, 3 people at one table and 2 at the other. The tables could not be pushed together so we were a long way from each other. Funny setup but we laughed it off.

Then we ordered and were waiting for over an hour to receive food. My food was cold and overcooked, so I sent it back. I then had to wait another 30 mins for food. My family were finished by the time it arrived. It had a hair in it this time, but I couldn't be bothered saying it.

We had to collect my daughter from work so didn't have to time in the two hours we were there to have dessert. It was an utter shambles.

My wife overheard issues at other tables as well and the kitchen was under pressure because of an event upstairs apparently.

So here's a tip. Either staff up so you can cater for the numbers you take in, or limit the numbers you take in so you can give quality if service that reflects what you charge. It might also be an idea to train your very young and polite staff effectively. I felt sorry for them.

While I get you were busy, its not an excuse to me. There was nothing wrong with the 154 euro I earned and dropped for you to spoil our evening. I'm sure banks are very busy too but you still got paid on time and in full by me for a crap service."
"Silver Key Bar & Restaurant",141,"Ruth M",2198,"4 months ago",3,"A little disappointed with the food. Not as tasty as my last visit. I had Eggs Benedict.

"Vicarstown Bar",142,"Hyun Cozzi",1061,"a month ago",1,"Please avoid and spend your money elsewhere
Before we ordered our last drink we asked the bartender how much drinking up time is allowed and his reply was 30 minutes so we ordered a pint
Within 10:Minutes We were been harassed by 3 bouncers
I told him politely I was informed I had 30 minutes as the bartender had told me before I ordered my beer. I even asked for a plastic container if they wanted to close early but NO ,Obey the law and be fair ,
The other negative reviews reflect the same opinions so it‚Äôs actually genuine
Maybe we will send some undercover gardai to investigate this and your other bars
I would appreciate a reply to this review as we are not letting this go .

The bartender is such a lovely lady with an Irish accent that makes you want to bring her back home with you. They let you sample all of their beers until you find just the right one. Might I suggest the Rebel Red. Couple of them and soon you‚Äôll forget all about the insurance you had to buy from the rental car company.
The vibe was perfect too. There is outside seating where you can actually have a conversation and hear. And to top it off, Pompeii Pizza is right there. Probably the second best pizza I‚Äôve had in my life!!!
So quit him hawing around and get yourself over there! You won‚Äôt be sorry!"

A tall and overly cranky fella served a ""coffee"" and I was 4 euro lighter. I took a few coffee sips and drove on. As I took a few more sips on the drive the actual taste was disgusting and I ended up leaving most of the ""coffee""  in the cup as it tasted like left over dish water. What a disgusting waste of money.
When I got home I made a real coffee on my Sage Bambino which tasted delicious. I won't be wasting my time with Crush again"

"Crush Coffee",144,"Ciara Higgins",506,"a year ago",1,"Visited on the 14th of September with high hopes after reading other reviews. Needless to say, we were left nothing short of disappointed.

Staff was rude and unattentive and consistently took phone calls within the 3 minutes we waited to order and receive our drinks.

Our order of iced coffee with caramel syrup was received with no syrup, and considering the abnormally high price, I would assume we were still charged for it.

We also ordered cakes, which were nothing special but considering the rest of our experience, perhaps the best part."
"Crush Coffee",144,"Josh Mulcahy",1302,"a year ago",1,"Very poor experience - 14th Sept - hostile service while consistently being on phone while dealing with customers. Forgot caramel syrup in iced coffees and the size is quite mediocre for the expensive price.

"Costa",350,"Giorgio Berardi",967,"a year ago",4,"I was here twice before reading some of the recent very bad reviews, but I must admit I found the place pleasant overall. It is large enough to guarantee you'll always find seating space, except perhaps at peak times.

"The Abbot's Ale House",145,"Tony Anetts",2525,"10 months ago",5,"Just a brilliant craft beer bar! Anton, the owner, is a massive character who knows who he is - we shared laughs,  shots, and beers with him when he wasn't singing with the band - what a treat.

Shout out to Finbar also,  who works the bar - a quintessential Irish character who was an absolute hoot to share stories and shots with. A brilliant couple of nights in a bar with a terrific beer selection and people who care about craft beer.  I couldn't recommend this place more highly."

Best pub in the City üòéüíØ"
"The Abbot's Ale House",145,"L√©a Ludwiller",1482,"8 months ago",5,"During our recent visit to Cork, we were fortunate enough to stumble upon The Abbot's Ale House, and it quickly became the highlight of our trip! From the moment we walked in, we were struck by the incredibly warm and welcoming atmosphere of the pub. It‚Äôs the kind of place where the staff genuinely care about making you feel at home.

To begin with, we were especially touched by the musicians, The D's, who were performing that evening. In a wonderful display of hospitality, they actually paused their performance to greet us personally and make us feel welcome‚Äîsomething you don‚Äôt experience every day! It‚Äôs these little gestures that really set this pub apart and made us feel like we were part of the family.

The owner of the pub was equally generous, going out of his way to ensure our comfort. In fact, when we couldn‚Äôt find a seat, he offered us his own chair, an act of kindness that made us feel truly valued as guests. It‚Äôs rare to encounter such genuine hospitality, and it made our experience even more special.

As for the selection of drinks, they offer a fantastic variety of beers that caters to all tastes. Whether you're a fan of local craft brews or international favorites, you'll find something to enjoy here.

The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with beautiful, thoughtful decoration that creates a relaxed, yet vibrant space. The pub's interior has a charm that makes it feel both timeless and contemporary, offering a perfect setting for a quiet drink or a lively night out.

A final mention must go to the barman, who made our visit even more memorable. Not only was he of incredible advice on the nightlife in the city, but his sense of humor and hugging skills made him the best bartender we encountered in Cork. A true testament to the pub's friendly vibe, he helped make our time at The Abbot‚Äôs unforgettable.

Overall, The Abbot's Ale House is a must-visit for anyone in Cork looking for great beer, warm hospitality, and a cozy space to relax and enjoy the local culture. We can‚Äôt recommend it enough!"
"The Abbot's Ale House",145,"Soundy Sound",2369,"2 weeks ago",3,"It's an interesting pub, no doubt but the prices are ridiculous when compared to other craft beer bars in the city. ‚Ç¨8 for a 5.5% Irish IPA? ‚Ç¨4 for a half pint or Irish red?? It's not so special a bar to justify those prices."
"The Abbot's Ale House",145,"M√≥nica Afonso",1818,"a year ago",5,"Best pub in town!

Original post: If you like beer, and are looking for a change from the Irish stouts and Coors Light served in every pub, then you MUST visit Abbot‚Äôs Ale House. I lived in Cork for a year before we discovered it, and I feel like a year has been wasted. This is now my favorite bar in Cork. Why? The rotating beer list, the variety of can offerings, the fact that it is also a full bar, the vibe, the quaintness of it, the music, the people, the friendly owner. It checks every box for me. Even the box for Imperial Stout Slushy! The only down side is the hours of operation which are limited.
Again, if you like beer, then go."

Genuinely, these guys are making seriously good food. The burger was perfect. The right amount of pickle etc but the stars were the patties and the sauce. I had the double smasher and the patties were crispy and caramelized on the outside and beautifully juicy in the middle. The flavour was awesome. The sauce I only know as their house TB sauce(guard that recipe with your lives). It was layered with creaminess, umami and an amazing spice. As good a burger as you can get.

The cheesy chips were perfectly cooked and the mix of the cheese sauce, dried jalapeno flakes and their house spice blend raised the bar.

So many places get so close to perfecting what they do and get 90% of the way there but Tirab has it mastered.

Thanked the 2 guys who made the food in the way out. I WILL BE BACK"

We walked to the burger stall, they had an electronic ordering board system. So the 5 of us started ordering. We went to pay for the food only to be told that there was no meat left everything was sold out. We couldn't believe it. How could you sell out 1.5hours before you close? Just didn't make sense. Only giving 2 for food as the burgers on the ordering board looked so nice. We were bitterly disappointed.  Have extra stock on venue days and weekends."

"Tedo Tapas Bar",148,"Jasmine Dempsey",1166,"a year ago",5,"Situated on Princess street Cork City. Pre booking made, nice welcome on arrival.
We had 8 dishes: Duck spring rolls, Korean chicken tenders, chilli con carne, beef enchiladas, Aubergine fritters, Arancini, Patatas Bravas & breads with dips along with a drink each (wine,beer & and soft drink) and it came to ‚Ç¨79 which is good value.
We really enjoyed each dish top three being:  Chilli con carne, Spring rolls & chicken tenders.
Nice atmosphere throughout on a Thursday evening and will definitely revisit"
"Tedo Tapas Bar",148,"Sneha",2353,"3 years ago",4,"Variety of small plate options for everyone. Most dishes tasty, nice sauces, and tinier sizing compared to other tapas places.

"Tedo Tapas Bar",148,"Lhamo Fitzsimons",1501,"4 years ago",1,"Shocking and horrifying experience and food.
Will never return and beg anyone reading this not to go here.
The food is clearly all heated from frozen.
My food was dry, bland,chewy and the sauce was watery and flavourless.
The calamari was rubber in dried bread and not properly prepared,the nerves which are like natural rubber bands were not removed.
I could not finish the dish and was not charged for it when I showed the wait staff the strings of elastic in my food.
The food is clearly over plated in an attempt to distract from the horrific quality but the decorations are either flavourless coloured thickened water or squeeze bottle sauces from ice cream trucks.
Another horrifying experience was lying in wait in the bathrooms.
On the inside of the women's bathroom is a floor to ceiling, wall to wall pin up of a naked man- in the men's bathrooms there is a corresponding picture of a woman.
The toilets themselves are so tiny that I, a small 5""3 woman couldn't shut the door without my knees being pressed up against it. The food made me and everyone traveling  with me ill for the next day"

The samosas had a really lovely flavour as had the mozarella sticks. A must try if you like tapas and nice portions as well."

I should have gotten one particular girls name, I regret that - she was so sweet. She is doing a PLC marketing course, that's all I know about her really. We just passed for a cup of soup and a rest while my dad was in the CUH. It was a stressful day but the staff have to be complimented for their polite, attentive and genuine manner. I WILL be back. It's not everywhere that can accommodate the elderly (and their dementia!) but this was just super duper.

Older Irish people will remember Dunnes stores years ago did an unbranded cellophane wrapped pizza with slidey tomato and cheese fused together, so if you bit it too late you could pull it all off the pizza without touching the base. The pizza here was like that: had the same rubbery cheese and base texture. The pepperoni was tasteless and curled up, like from a pack at tescos. This pizza was ‚Ç¨16.

My partner and her friend got stuff that was ‚Ç¨9+ which was also pretty tasteless and not at all what was expected.

Again, the staff were really friendly - but there are so many places within five minutes or less walk which serve similar food at similar prices, and are way way better."

Public parking is available nearby

They also offer a large selection of cakes, ice cream, tarts and cookies but you absolutely should try an italian cannoli
You can get 6 for ‚Ç¨5 and they are absolutely delish. Perfect with coffee, they also have different options on filling milk or white chocolate.

They also sell coffee which is nice, could be a little stronger but not bad.
It‚Äôs very popular so you more than likely will have to queue but worth it
Opens about 8 and closes around 5pm

Today when shopping downtown, my kid got hungry and crave for Starbucks sandwich. So we went to Starbucks. I place an order for a coffee, drink for my kid, and toasted sandwich.

Staff: we shouldn‚Äôt toast it for you
Me: Why? I always get it toasted
Staff: we shouldn‚Äôt do it, it‚Äôs cross contamination
Me: So you can‚Äôt do it?
Staff: we shouldn‚Äôt
Me: Can you tost it for me?
Staff: I can‚Äôt

So I took my kid, hop in a car and we went to Starbucks in Blackpool. I place same order, staff ask me: ‚Äúwould you like it toasted?‚Äù yes, thank you.

Why the hell am I getting such a different service experience, in 2 different branches of Starbucks in the same City?

And what type of cross contamination egg sandwich does? I get it, if it‚Äôs fish with chicken or beef. But egg sandwich? Even if it‚Äôs about gluten free, I‚Äôm the one ordering, and I don‚Äôt mind a scrap of gluten on it. It was rely annoying, mostly because my kid was looking forward to eat sandwich in city centre and have ice cream after.

I end up driving across the city to outlet that I know toast sandwiches no problem, and the drive back to city center to buy promised  ice cream."

"Counihans Bar",154,"Thomas Thornton",2487,"2 years ago",4,"Counihans Bar is another brilliant pub in Cork City center!
They have a good selection of different beers and stouts to choose from and since it was Summer time I decided to have a couple of pint bottles of Bulmers cider.
As far as stout goes, I think that this is more of a Murphy's pub than a Guinness pub as most people were ordering Murphy's. I did however order one Guinness to try it and it was only ok.

Layout:
The bar is fairly big and is split into a few areas.
You have a bar counter and snug area when you enter from Pembroke Street.
The snug is really nice as there is a large table that can fit about 6 to 8 people.
If you enter from Phoenix Street the bar is a little retangular area with a bar counter and few tables and chairs.
There is a larger area out the back with a dance floor area and more seating and another bar counter to order from.

Decor:
Counihans is an old timey bar is decorated in such fashion.
Timber lines the walls and there are pictures and flags decorating the bar.
There is a fire place in the area off of Pembroke Street which may or may not be functional as it was in July when I visited the bar and it was not lit.

The Staff:
The staff are friendly and welcoming. The counter service was a little slow but I feel that they were training a new bartender at time that were there.
I would ask for your reciept as one member of our group was charged twice for some of the items on her drink order, it was a mistake on the bartenders part however, it can't hurt to double check.

Overall Opinion:
Counihans Bar is an old school bar right beside the GPO in the city center!
I highly recommend stopping by for a pint of beer or cider, might want to give the Guinness a skip or else order a pint of another stout like Murphy's instead.
Definitely a great bar for if you want to have a good auld chat with friends!
Solid 7 out of 10 pub for me!"

"Son of a Bun",157,"Daniel Farrelly",616,"3 months ago",5,"We ate here one Friday evening after a 40 minute wait for a table. The place was extremely busy but the service was still reasonably quick. The food was really good. Our only issue was that we ordered too much of it (mac & cheese is quite heavy as a side dish). Thankfully the staff were able to package some of my wife's unfinished salad to take away."
"Counihans Bar",154,"Ali buttimer",139,"3 months ago",1,"This place has honestly left me lost for words. After a nice meal in cork city me and my boyfriend (22), went on a quest to find a nice quiet Irish pub to play some cards and unwind.
We stumbled upon this place and its lack of a Saturday night crowd enticed us, we sat down and quickly realised the guy next to us was the establishment‚Äô owner due to him talking with another guy as they drank whiskey and he spoke in pure arrogance and utter disrespect towards his staff and clientele(as if it was their fault the pub was empty), honestly this alone gave me a sick feeling but I ignored it and continued to play our harmless game of cards which involved no money I may add.
As I approached the bar to order our third round of drinks(at an extortionate price) I abruptly heard this extremely aggressive man shout at my boyfriend,
completely unprovoked ‚Äúget them away we will have none of that here‚Äù- as if we had a bag of narcotics on the table(referring to the deck of cards). I returned to the table and asked the ‚Äúowner‚Äù why he didn‚Äôt make it apparent to us that this was not aloud and I was curious as to why such a ridiculous rule was enforced ?- he responded- ‚Äúwhat are you on about I don‚Äôt own this place‚Äù him and his friend laughed, although his friend seemed to have second hand embarrassment for his lack of self awareness (we had been able to hear his whole conversation for two hours prior).
Please give your custom to any other establishment in cork as I am baffled this place isn‚Äôt derelict."
"Counihans Bar",154,"Ciara",503,"a year ago",3,"Nice pub to watch the All Ireland in. Big screen out the back, lots of space. Staff are friendly and efficient.

However, I thought ‚Ç¨7 for a pint of non-alcoholic Carlsberg was a bit much, the alcoholic pints were cheaper. Note it was also my first time in Cork so I'm not sure if this is standard for a non-alcoholic pint in the city."
"Counihans Bar",154,"Calen Watt",409,"3 months ago",1,"Rude bouncers, will kick patrons out for seemingly no reason. Wouldn‚Äôt return and wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
"Salt Food & Wine",159,"Thomas Thornton",2487,"a year ago",5,"Salt is a little cosy restaurant in the heart of the marina in Ballintemple!
It is a great restaurant to swing by for brunch or dinner or drinks! Especially before a gig in P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh!

The Staff:
The staff are really friendly and attentive.
The waiting staff as well as the kitchen staff are very accomodating if you wanted to make a change to the item that you are prdering. Such as the type of bread or maybe not using sour cream in the item that you are ordering, etc.

The Food:
I first started coming here in 2018 and back then the menu used to change daily and with the seasons.
When we visited a few times during las year I noticed that it now seems to be a set menu, well at least the ""La Carte"" menu seems to be set.
I ordered the ""Anticucho Burger"" and my fianc√©e ordered the ""Eggs Benedict"". She modified her order by swapping out the toasted muffin for a slice of toasted sourdough instead!
I thought that maybe ordering the Anticucho Burger at half 10 in the morning would be too heavy but it was bar far the best thing I have gotten at Salt so far!
The chicken was juicy and lightly spiced with beautiful tomatoes, lettuce and a dollop of their homemade Aji Verde!
It was accompanied by their homemade garlic and parsley wedges!
The Eggs Benedict is always a winner when it comes to a breakfast item and the protions are certainly satisfying at Salt! We highly recommend it if you are feeling something hearty for the morning!

Food Note:
Their wedges are really really good and I would suggest ordering them as a side if the item that you are ordering does not come with them!
You won't regret it!
They also list what options they serve that there is a Dairy or Gluten option available, just look at the menu for details.

Location:
Located in the little coner between Victoria Rd. and Monahan Rd.
The area is quiet and I think this plays very well for Salt as there is usually parking close by however, sometimes you might have a short walk.

Layout & Decor:
The restaurant has an outdoor area to the front of the premises and as you enter there is a number of seats at the front with a little elevated den area as well.
The main seating area is located near the front and as you walk throught this area towards the back you will see that there is another outdoor area at the back with more seating.
Both outdoor areas are covered with an awning and there is a heater in the rear outdoor area to keep customers warm.
The decor is unique with pictures, posters, statues, etc.

Booking Note:
If you want to sit inside I would book in advance especially on a busy weekend to ensure that you have a table as the premises is small and can fill up really fast!

Overall Opinion:
Salt is definitely a great spot for brunch or dinner and it is also a good location in the Marina for drinks.
They serve delicious food with a variety of options and its the perfect place on a warm Summer's eveing for a lite bite and cool drinks!
I love it and I highly recommend coming here!"
"The Friary",155,"Adam Buckley",39,"a year ago",5,"Great little bar with a trendy crowd, great selection of only craft beer. Staff are lovely and the vibe is great. Nice bar to spend an evening in!

Great events and similar are in it too! My personal drink of choice would be Stag stout or Kegs Benedict."
"The Friary",155,"Oleksandr Rivkind",1935,"a month ago",5,"Wanted to try Stag Stout and it exceeded expectations. Very nice pub. Must visit."
"The Friary",155,"Travis Brink",2536,"a year ago",5,"My girlfriend and I happened to bumble in here on pub trivia night (Wednesday), which was great fun. The unique decor is cozy old tavern filtered through a teenage boy's bedroom, I'm glad i didn't encounter any crusty socks, but I'm not sure if I'd have been surprised if I did. Good selection of liquor as well as a fanatical devotion to the master thespian, Sir Nicolas Coppola. Great Craic!"
"The Friary",155,"Peter Acker",2032,"2 months ago",5,"Stellar craft beer selection and amusing collection of Nicolas Cage memorabilia, well worth a visit!!"
"The Friary",155,"Luke Ratterman",1580,"Edited 3 years ago",5,"This pub takes you back in time when you first walk in. From the basement bathrooms to the 200+ year old decor it feels like you are family right away. This is a craft beer only bar where they even have their own brewed just for them and only served here called the kegs benedict! I can imagine a cold wintery night this place would be a cozy place to have a drink by the fire."
"The Friary",155,"Thomas Thornton",2487,"7 months ago",5,"The Friary is without question my favourite pub in all of Cork city!
Mike and his wonderful staff have a really unique vibe going on between the decor and their game nights. I guarantee you'll have a great time in the Friary and enjoy one of their wide selection of local beers on tap or in the fridge.

The Staff:
Mike is a brilliant Cork publican and he is easy to spot if he is there as he'll be the man with a brightly coloured shirt and long wavy hair. Both he and his staff have created a unique pub with a very casual atmosphere on the corner across from the North Gate Bridge where you will feel right at home with yhe locals.

Events:
There is always something going on between the weekly Wednesday quiz and any number of fun filled events that take place on the weekends. There is always a raffel after the Wednesday quiz and usually the top prize is either a Nicholas Cage or a Keanu Reeves themed pillow cover or t-shirt.
You'll definitely find something that will tickle your fancy.

Layout:
The main bar is on ground level with seating at the bar as well as tables and chairs along the wall. There is also additional seating upstairs however, choose wisely if its a Wednesday night as there is fierce rivalry between the two levels.
What I find a bit unique for a Cork pub is that the restrooms are located downstairs.
There is a small amount of seating out front of the bar which is lovely on a nice sunny day to enjoy a cold drink.

Decor:
This is a unique pub for Cork as it is decorated with everything that is Nicholas Cage! From movie posters to homemade 3-D printed heads this pub has got it all.
They regularly have game nights where new decorations are added to the walls and ceiling so what is there this week may have changed by next week however, Nicholas Cage remains a constant.

Drinks:
They don't serve the mainstream beers here but what you will find is a wide variety of local and not so local beers both on tap and in can form.
Personally I'm a stout and cider guy but I have come to love the Indian Summer beer and Kirin Ichiban beer along with the Stag Stout to name a few.
If you want someyhing a little stronger they also have a wider variety of local distiller's whiskeys, gins and vodkas so there is something for everybody.

Overall Opinion:
Over the years I've come to love many pubs in Cork but none as much as the Friary! It has a unique feel to it and they make you feel right at home.
I highly recommend stopping by Friary's for a drink of your choosing and have a good auld chat with bar staff and you won't be long making friends!"
"The Friary",155,"John Griffin",1257,"9 months ago",5,"Excellent pub! I cannot put it into words how much the atmosphere, regular patrons and the staff make this one of, if not the best, pubs in the city of Cork! The lines are spotless, the pints, crisp and sharp and the spirits selection can meet almost all tastes. If you‚Äôre a fan of whiskey and or IPA‚Äôs, you‚Äôll be happy as a pig in shit.

10/10!"
"The Friary",155,"Assunta D",285,"7 years ago",5,"We went in for a drink after work.
It is an excellent place: cosy and with a good atmosphere!
There is a good selection of craft beers, but the cider was amazing :)
The owner of the place is very welcoming and friendly.
I will definitely go back!"
"The Friary",155,"Roberto C",2153,"6 months ago",5,"I was on hollyday in Cork, and this was for me one of the best pubs I've ever been, not only for the beer and good prices. The owner is a huge showman and a really good person. I personally would like to say thank you for all we laughed in your place and the good shared moments. Definitely would go again if I come back to Cork!!"
"The Friary",155,"Luca Schiatti",1559,"3 months ago",5,"Come for the Nicholas Cage theme, stay for the craft beer, love it for the people behind the counter. With their themed nights Mike, John, Dai and Helen will make you feel both welcome and weird (in the most amazing way)"

I wasn't expecting such a high level of service and cleanliness for a hostel. This place deserves its 5 üåü rating.

"Son of a Bun",157,"Trish Lambert",2544,"2 months ago",5,"We came here for a family meal recently, there was 4 adults and 3 kids. We all ordered burgers and sides, followed by desserts. The food is absolutely delicious here and the staff are so friendly. There's a lovely relaxed atmosphere. The only downside is having to wait for a table but I guess it's because the place is so popular and rightly so... So having said that, it is definitely worth the wait, and hopefully we'll get back there soon!"
"Son of a Bun",157,"Francisco Zeno Jr",902,"3 months ago",4,"I am currently here from the States for work. I waited 30 minutes until they opened up. It was well worth the wait! I got The One (no mayo and with cheddar instead of American)with the fries with skin on them which the  recommended. Both the burger and fries were so good! Waiter was cordial and good atmosphere. I highly recommend Son of a Bun. Can‚Äôt wait until my next visit."
"Son of a Bun",157,"David Sanders",675,"5 months ago",5,"Really good burgers that are huge! Fries are a side rather than included in the burger price, and to be honest, we probably didn‚Äôt need them. We had the burger of the month which included white pudding ü§§ The vanilla milkshake was one of the best I‚Äôve ever had üëç"
"Son of a Bun",157,"Chlo√© Morineau",467,"3 weeks ago",5,"I don't usually give 5 stars but damn those burgers hit the spot. The kimchi one was spicy and tasty, the taco one with fried peppers was perfectly seasoned, the S.O.B was generous and good and the waffle one was very good with the sugary salty flavors. For the sides, the Mac and cheese was very good and the fries crispy. The only thing I'd have to say is that it's very loud inside."
"Son of a Bun",157,"Rob S",2135,"2 weeks ago",5,"Another recommendation from the great staff at the Residence Inn.  We went here on a Monday and honestly this was not our first choice but lots of places were closed.  We were trying to had and should have picked Son of a Bun earlier!

I got a ""normal"" burger.  You wouldn't know from the picture but under that half head of lettuce was an awesome paddy.  Dont get me wrong, I like lots of lettuce and tomato on my burger!  We ended up splitting the fries and that was a good call because they were a LOT.  SO got a Portobello mushroom burger and it was MASSIVE.

Service was fast and excellent.  Note - this is a loud location.  Fun and energetic but loud.  Not hurt your ears loud but dont expect to acquire some zen.

Great food, great price and great service.

Recommended."
"Son of a Bun",157,"Emily Harris",811,"a month ago",5,"Best meal I've had in all of Ireland so far! Though I would definitely not consider it traditional Irish food of course, lol. We had the taco fries and the were to so incredibly good! We also had the chicken and waffle burger, which was also fantastic!! Wish we had this place near home!"
"Son of a Bun",157,"Kigo Orgil",1439,"a month ago",5,"Easily my favourite burger spot in Cork City. The atmosphere is cool and welcoming, the menu has so many great options, and every burger I‚Äôve tried has been delicious. I‚Äôll 100% be back for another visit. Can‚Äôt wait to go back again."
"Son of a Bun",157,"Nick",1887,"4 months ago",5,"These burgers will knock your socks off!

They are huge and full of flavor. The place was packed but there are plenty of servers to keep it all moving along. The fries are huge portions which are great for sharing."
"Son of a Bun",157,"Anthony Kerr",244,"3 months ago",5,"10/10 burgers,we had lunch here on Friday and we both agreed that they're the best burgers we've ever had.

"The Welcome Inn",158,"A J (Lexi)",14,"a month ago",5,"Top 5 favorites! Great live music, the man's voice was great. Wish I had gotten the name of the musician. Oh and Beamish!! Just down the street from the Clayton hotel and open early as well. Bartender was nice"
"The Welcome Inn",158,"Ruth Kershaw",2197,"4 months ago",5,"Fantastic pub, thoroughly enjoyed our night here. Staff are a great laugh and atmosphere is very welcoming and homely as you‚Äôd expect from an Irish pub. Highly recommend visiting here. There was a band playing who were great."
"The Welcome Inn",158,"Eamonn Boland",758,"2 months ago",5,"Great pub with lovely pints and unique live music performances, with a whiskey selection like no other!
Early morning or late evenings worth a visit."
"The Welcome Inn",158,"Francesco Bianchi",898,"a year ago",5,"I wasn't sure about trying this pub but then a friend who was visiting Ireland insisted to, attracted by the promise of live music. I'm so glad he did!

The Welcome Inn is small inside, with some nice tables outdoor. Some partitions help forgetting that one is very close to the road.

We decided to stay indoor though, where we were super lucky to find free one of the tables available. This one was small but also right in front of the musicians.

The duo played very well a mix of traditional Irish reels & tunes plus some international songs re-arranged for guitar & banjo.

The selection of whiskeys available is impressive, which is not too surprising considering that the largest distillery in Ireland is only a few kilometers away.

Clientele was a beautiful mix of tourists (mostly at the tables) and locals (mostly at the bar). Both the barman and the locals gave us some great tips on what whiskey to try."
"The Welcome Inn",158,"Rob Hillman",2134,"2 weeks ago",4,"At one end of William Plunkett St in Cork city you'll find The Welcome Inn. It's about the size of standard living room but outsized as a pub. It was full of men and women, busily chatting with background music trying to butt in. There were hugs and kisses whenever someone came in, or left, and the very pleasant and efficient barman was working his socks off to serve his customers. We were offered a seat for the 4 of us almost immediately but, instead of leaving, the lady moved to another table to continue her chatting and drinking. The 8 pints of Beamish we drank over the next hour or so were also splendid. If you are ever in the area you must check it out. You'll be made most Welcome."

"The Welcome Inn",158,"Guilherme vieira",998,"7 months ago",5,"Amazing last place before I got to Airport .
S√≥ many different Irish whisky‚Äôs and great to see some forgotten Irish beers as Harp and Smithwicks .

Nice fire place and good music playing also .
Also drank Paddy again( just arrived at my home country few years ago) . Very local (guess Middleton is taking care)

What an incredible surprise ."
"Fingas - Afro Restaurant and Lounge",161,"Nauan Cabrini",1862,"3 months ago",1,"Be careful in that place, first in the menu was 9,99 for the Lamb suya, when them put at the system became 11,99, when delivered was that portion in the picture, I asked if was right the chef said yes, and that's it, I don't recommend"
"The Welcome Inn",158,"George Kyritsis",945,"Edited 2 years ago",5,"I came upon this place by accident but it is a treasure if you want to experience something out of an era long gone.  The atmosphere is inviting, friendly typical of Irish hospitality ! You are guaranteed to strike up an interesting conversation with the locals!  Sit down, relax have a nice pint of Irish stout or if you wish, even a shot of the most expensive whiskey!  Those bottles are high up on a shelf and some of them are marked not for sale! This is the only Day Pub left in Cork and is located at the beginning of Oliver Plunket St. on the side close to the Bus station at Parnel Place.  If you want to experience its unique and quaint atmosphere and meet genuinely interesting characters, this is definitely the place to visit!"

The sunny terrace is a big plus, especially in Ireland, and the atmosphere is great. The food is spectacular, Ihad the Eggs Benedict, and my companion had the √áƒ±lbƒ±r waffle (see photos). Both dishes were perfectly prepared and full of flavor. For dessert, we ordered the French toast, which is only available after 12 PM, and it was absolutely delicious. Our server, Oph√©lie, was very attentive and made our experience even better. Highly recommende,"

"Salt Food & Wine",159,"Jasmine Dempsey",1166,"a year ago",4,"Situated in Ballintemple, short stroll from Cork city. Outdoor & indoor seating and they offer takeaway.
Nice welcome on arrival, brunch menu: we went for the French toast with banana almond, chocolate sauce &
Chantilly and the mushroom & Brie skillet. French toast was overly smothered but it was very tasty..
Mushroom dish was delicious and would highly recommend. Friendly staff and prompt service (expect for cleaning away our empty plates)
Reasonably priced and lovely throughout with plenty of fresh tasty deserts to choose from. Nice menu and would highly recommend a visit"

"Salt Food & Wine",159,"Flor Mendoza Diaz",890,"2 months ago",1,"Last Saturday morning I took my friend to the restaurant for breakfast for her birthday. The weather was perfect, and we were seated outdoors, it was the kind of morning that makes you feel grateful just to be there. We ordered coffees and soon after, our food. The food did take about 40 minutes to arrive, but we didn‚Äôt mind too much at the time since we were enjoying a relaxed conversation.

Unfortunately, things took a turn. About 10 minutes after our meals arrived, a waiter came over and let us know our table had been reserved for other guests and we would need to leave in less than 30 minutes. He explained that the waitress had forgotten to mention this earlier. There was no offer to move us to a different table. It felt rushed and awkward, I genuinely lost my appetite.

About 15 minutes later, the waitress, who was lovely and very apologetic, came back and kindly offered to move us to the side chairs so she could prepare the table for the next guests. We couldn't go inside because we had a dog with us and we totally understood that. We agreed, but sitting there we no longer felt welcome, and I couldn‚Äôt enjoy the rest of the meal. I ended up taking it with me, paid, and we quietly left.

It‚Äôs a shame how the situation was handled, it left us disappointed, especially considering it was a special morning."
"Salt Food & Wine",159,"Tim Davies",2493,"4 months ago",5,"They squeezed us in on a busy Sunday morning! Excellent coffee and the best BLT I've eaten in years ... probably helped by the fried egg and the cajun chicken that the waiter suggest was ""out of this world"" - he wasn't wrong.

"Salt Food & Wine",159,"Andrew Pope",201,"a year ago",4,"Went here for brunch around 2:30pm on a Sunday. We managed to get a booking as it was slightly after the lunch rush. I had Eggs Benedict which was great. I really loved the addition of caramelised onions. My wife was very impressed with the Kiwi - smashed avocado with fresh Pico de Gallo. If you're a carnivore, add bacon. Even better. Our daughter inhaled her French toast. Nice buzzy brunch spot that does nice twists on the classics. We will be back."

The Age Gyoza was very well cooked and seasoned. It tasted very well with the tartar sauce. It also was not very greasy, which was the best of that appetizer.
Sincere gratitude to the amazing, skilled cooks for that!
The staff was very kind and respectful, they even offer green tea from time to time, which is definitely foreign to me until now.

Absolute great recommendation to people living here and also especially tourists who want to experience walking through Cork City. Definitely have a good grab of food from this place!

All the best."
"Wabisabi Sushi and Noodles Bar",160,"Adele",48,"a year ago",5,"I had lunch here today and ordered sushi and some starters plus dessert.

The meals accommodates different taste buds and as the only African restaurant I am aware of in Cork, I repeat visits.
However, the meal prep could use some alterations.
The staff tries to accommodate people‚Äôs choice but some factors remains.
Although most of their meals come out fresh, some of the ones I have tried  seems not so fresh.
For the price of the food, considering how expensive African foodstuff costs, they can try to offer more off the pot, fresh and hot meals.
Thank you to the owner for the initiative, thanks to the chef that makes the amazing meals and the wait staff especially my personal favourite Te amor( I‚Äôm sorry if I didn‚Äôt get your name correct).
I will keep coming and bringing more friends because the ones that have come so far, love it ."
"Fingas - Afro Restaurant and Lounge",161,"Yewande Ladejobi",2632,"6 months ago",5,"The Gizdodo was so good, rhe dodo was so soft it basically melted in my mouth, the Gizard was a bit tough but that's just my teeth I love my meats baby soft.

I'd give it 9.5/10 cause of the Gizard but that's just my teeth.

Meatpie was so good, not a lof of filling but thats to be expected since it's just a starting restaurant. The pastry was so good it was so soft and sweet and it paired really well with the filling.

10/10 I wish there was more than just 2 but I'm glad there was cause i had toom for more food.

Egusi was nice, like I was tempted to lick the bowl it was so good. It was so good, best part was the portion I got had no fish and minimal fish bone so I was even happier. The poma (can't remember the spelling) was so good it melted in my mouth and the meat was so soft I love it.

10/10 I wish I licked the bowl.

My sisters thoughts on the Ogbono. It's very good. Which from her is a 10/10.

She was almost as fast as me when eating her food. I tried some of the Ogbono and it tasted do good.

So overall, i would rate this Restaurant 10/10. Will be coming here everytime i come to the city."
"Fingas - Afro Restaurant and Lounge",161,"Sele Clement",2303,"6 months ago",4,"I came here for some African cuisine and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The food is good and the service and politeness of the owner and chef is excellent. The food is a bit expensive for what it is but I understand it‚Äôs only opened up and finding it feet.

I know things are still only being set up but from what I can see this place has serious potential!

I will definitely come back down when I‚Äôm in Cork next."

"Fingas - Afro Restaurant and Lounge",161,"layi Olatoye",1481,"4 months ago",1,"The Owner of Fingas wanted to beat me up a (woman), I was given what was not described in the menu and questioned it.

I visited Fingas restaurant 19/05/2025  and ordered Egusi and pounded yam. I asked the waiter what protein comes with the meal she stated Assorted is in the soup, I asked if I could order goat meat, she said I could get it as a side.
The food came,  I started to eat and noticed Ishan was a lot in the soup and stock fish. I was talking to the friend I came with to the restaurant that I‚Äôm not happy about this , they stated assorted expecting beef, Abodi, Roundabout, shaki and the likes.

A man approached me and said what the problem was I said I don‚Äôt like the protein it‚Äôs hard and it‚Äôs not assorted, he said to hold on and called the Owner. The Owner approached me and asked what the problem was I said this is not assorted this is just hard Ishan parts in my soup, I further stated that the likes of shaki,abodi, roundabout, beef was what I knew as an assorted mix.
He said, we don‚Äôt serve Abodi here rudely and don‚Äôt provide it, I said okay , but beef is also absent in the soup, he said they have beef, but they don‚Äôt have Abodi repeatedly and Rudely, then  walked away.

My Friend and I kept on speaking on how rude he was and didn‚Äôt even ask to rectify the issue. The owner came back and said, what is still the problem ,that he has said they don‚Äôt have it and I should leave the food if not pleased with it and was pointing his finger in my face and coming close to me while speaking
This escalated from 0-100 I stood up for myself and said he should never  point his fingers in my face, I‚Äôve not said anything wrong, he spoke to me rudely and walked away and I didn‚Äôt say anything. I felt bad about how he had responded to my complain but decided to keep cool only for him to walk back to my table a second time and pointed his fingers and asked me to get out of the restaurant. It‚Äôs really sad that I was not treated with the minimum respect that a customer deserves to be treated with. Nothing was done about my complaints, I was disrespected, I don‚Äôt  think anybody deserves to be treated like that.

Maybe he is frustrated and is breaking down under pressure but I don‚Äôt think it should be taken out on customers."
"Fingas - Afro Restaurant and Lounge",161,"Fionn Kelleher",884,"6 months ago",1,"Hope to revise this rating in the future, and don't like giving a new spot this low a review. Unfortunately a table for 2 came close to ‚Ç¨90, and the portions were tiny. The chef told me my main meal was reheated as she left the building while we were dining. Great to taste flavours I don't usually, but if I'm paying these kind of prices, I expect my food to be freshly cooked.

Love to see an African restaurant pop up in Cork and was very excited to dine here when it finally opened. Unfortunately at this time I can't recommend dining here with the small portion sizes and overly high prices."

"Coffee Central",162,"Claire Healy",522,"2 years ago",1,"Visited the cafe today. It was not busy and the elderly woman behind the counter was extremely rude to my mother. She told her not to ‚Äòinterrupt‚Äô a member of staff when she was asking a question. Also told her to ‚Äòstep away‚Äô from the counter rather than help her. Left a very bad taste in my mouth. Would not recommend."
"Coffee Central",162,"Linda Haikola",1520,"a month ago",2,"We ordered a strawberry matcha and asked to make it a latte (so, a strawberry matcha latte). The staff member misunderstood and gave us a strawberry matcha and a regular latte instead. When we explained, they said ‚Äúmatcha is always a latte,‚Äù which was not correct. To be fair, we did get the correct strawberry matcha in the end and were allowed to leave the regular latte behind.
However, the way the staff handled the situation was disappointing. The server made unfriendly faces with another customer while preparing our drinks, and when it came time to pay, they didn‚Äôt even look at us. After we paid, they quickly turned away without any acknowledgment.
In our opinion, making faces at customers and ignoring them is not professional service. We won‚Äôt be coming back, and we hope other visitors are aware of this before choosing the place."
"Coffee Central",162,"Stephen Desmond",2390,"a year ago",1,"Honestly, when we are all being told to ‚Äúsupport local business in Cork‚Äù I have to ask myself why sometimes.

Let me start by saying the woman (who maybe is the owner) was extremely rude. I sat at the counter on the stool and waited as she chatted to a man for 3 minutes solid before asking me if I was ‚Äúalright‚Äù in a rude manner as if I were lost.

She then charged me ‚Ç¨4 for a hot chocolate on her credit card machine which I didn‚Äôt notice until sometime later, despite the fact that it said ‚Ç¨3.50 on the menu. It was a cup of lukewarm milk and I left half of it behind.

No goodbye or thanks as I left as the woman was simply too busy talking to her friend. Not recommended."

It is overpriced and not really high standard and a few of the staff look depressed there but the staff were nice I just felt bad for them. If it's all of them looking a bit sad it's usually the way they are treated by management, i know from personal experience.

This comment you made makes you seem deranged. I never knew about the rumours I stopped in and had bad coffee which is what I put down and your staff seemed sad how would you know if you ain't there.

"Cafe Depeche",163,"Thomas Moore",2481,"a month ago",5,"If the ambience sets the stage, it is the staff who bring Caf√© Depeche to life. The team here exemplifies what true hospitality means. From my very first visit, I was struck by the genuine smiles, attentive service, and an unmistakable sense that everyone working here genuinely cares about your experience. On busy mornings, when the line stretches out the door, staff move with graceful efficiency, never missing a beat and always greeting regulars by name.
What sets the staff apart is their attention to detail and their passion for service. Whether you are a newcomer or a daily customer, you are greeted as a valued guest. I have watched staff patiently answer questions about the menu, make thoughtful recommendations based on customer preferences, and accommodate dietary needs with both expertise and enthusiasm. There is an art to making people feel seen and remembered, and the Caf√© Depeche team has mastered it."

They don't do Pad Thai from Friday to Sunday which is important to note. But the menu has plenty of other options to choose from. It is truly an amazing restaurant. We will be back. The cost included 2 glasses of wine. If you want genuine Thai Local food this is the place to come.

Plenty of staff there, just not making any effort to do anything.  The 2 managers stood on the stairs all night looking at a match.  Asked someone to take our order,  he said I can take your food order but you have to go to the bar and order drinks yourself.  I have never in my life heard of anywhere where you can't get drinks with your food! You couldn't get served at the bar then, nobody would even make eye contact.   At the end, they couldn't figure out how to get our bill, after 10-12 mins, they gave  it to me and there was prosecco on there.  I was like, eh, i couldn't even order a drink,  how is there prosecco on here?! Absolute joke of a place. Run by muppets.

Very nice halloumi and lobster& prawn ravioli. Never had it before but really enjoyed it. Worth what I paid for sure. Same with the sirloin well done. Very nice overall. Both dishes cleaned.

Our server was very kind and funny as well. Forgot to get his name. Mexican chap. Very nice and after it took a while to get my drink he was so apologetic about it bless him.

The desert was beyond amazing for me. Honestly one of my favourite deserts of the year . Ferrero rocher choux. Just phenomenal. And the crumble was nice as well. But damn that ferrero is 10/10! Ended up at 110 all in all for 2 mains, 2 deserts, 2 cocktails and a pint of Heineken. In a high class city hotel restaurant that‚Äôs very doable for the lovely service. And really chill atmosphere.

Just annoyed at what I was wearing haha. Wasn‚Äôt expecting to dine in here. Again very nice job altogether. Especially nice for those tourists of you coming for a weekend staying in the city. No doubt you‚Äôll have a great eat. And music at half 9."

Cocktails are lovely and it's a great place for a catch up, especially before or after a night out , just a chilled atmosphere. The live music is lovely too, really matches the vibes. Never had food, but it does look good !"

"No.76",167,"Yvonne Madden",2644,"a year ago",4,"Always loved the ambience here but in later times I think they take the p*ss a bit with drinks prices.. Not a place you'd make your 'local' really either as the clientelle is quite particular.
Having said that they keep it well, it's always inviting and comfortable and location is superb.
Main bar doesn't do coffees which seems unusual to me and on one occasion they wouldn't let us source any from Lafyettes caf√© in the same hotelüßê
No.76 is often attracts older customers, especially during the week."

"Alchemy Coffee Cork at the Marina Market",168,"Thalita S",2466,"11 months ago",4,"Nice coffee. Staff not so friendly.
It would be more efficient if consecutive numbers were given for coffee orders as people get confused with random numbers making them think they missed their coffee collection. Consider hiring more staff, maybe staff would be friendlier then."

"Alchemy Coffee Cork at the Marina Market",168,"Soumendu Ghosh",2368,"Edited a year ago",1,"Following multiple visits I will conclude that it is not worth your time and money though. There are many other coffee shops in the Marina Market where you will be treated better.

They have a queuing system where they give you a paper slip with a number they verbally are supposed to call out when your order is ready, except that in the chaos you are very likely to miss out on hearing that and they will not put any effort in repeating that.

The black guy, and the girl with nose piercing are especially incompetent, more interested in chatting with, and giving preference to random people in the queue."
"Alchemy Coffee Cork at the Marina Market",168,"kieran Kenneally",1438,"2 years ago",2,"Lovely place, service was good and friendly but then again it wasn't busy.
Generally love the Marina Market but Alchemy is typical of the place in regards to price. ‚Ç¨7 for two coffee's and I'll be honest with you, mine was rubbish. Wattery, weak and without flavour, just a waste of money.
I can understand the rents in this place are probably high and that is passed on in price but at least provide a good product."

The food, like duck and chicken, might come with bone (do ask). The Hong Kong style roast duck is really tender, the crispy chilli chicken and the pepper beef are really good too.

The staff were really nice and helpful too, to give advise."
"Nosh 19",172,"Kim Morris",1441,"7 months ago",5,"Great place for really tasty Chinese food that is outside of the standard fare. The fish in the sea bass and pickled cabbage soup was remarkably fresh and the portion was generous. If you're not used to the type of heat from Sechuan peppers you might want to ask them to make your food mild for you.
I also tried the scallops there. Delicious!
Lovely friendly staff too."

The girl behind the bar said it would be ‚Ç¨28 for the two toasties. No chips no salad. I walked out still shocked and won't be rushing back.

Both were absolutely terrible when I was there on Friday evening. The ‚Äòmanager‚Äô working that evening had absolutely no customer service skills and was extremely rude and unprofessional.  Her colleague along side her working behind the bar had one of the worst attitudes in hospitality I have ever encountered. I did have a respectful a chat with the ‚Äòmanager‚Äô about her lack of professionalism and while she did listen, she was unable to offer any reasonable explanation for her behaviour.

We spent a few nights here, sat outside watching the world go by and in one of the many snug corners inside listening to some good music. It had a great vibe and atmosphere and seemed to cater for all ages, regulars and visitors.  The staff were very friendly and welcoming and helped point us in the right direction re our visit. The pub is really old and has some nice features, art and stained glass. We looked it up and saw a review where it was listed in the Telegraphs Top 100 pubs.

"John Henchy & Sons",175,"James Finn",1144,"a month ago",3,"On my last Friday night in Ireland, I arrived alone at JH & Sons to a large crowd both inside and out. I ordered a Guinness and found a spot to sit around back where there were three groups enjoying drinks and lively banter.

Feeling somewhat out of place, I relocated to a stool at the end of one of two bars, next to where patrons were ordering drinks. I ordered a Beamish and occasionally engaged in brief conversation with those waiting on their drinks.

The beers were exceptionally fresh and delicious.

The crowd was expectedly boisterous and loud and the bartenders were quite busy. Rising above the din of the crowd was the recurrent laughter of assumably drunken female clientel - earily remiscent of the Wicked Witch of the West leaving on her broom.

I was enjoying myself up until it was time for me to order my third pint. I had decided that I would have a Murphy's to complete my comparison of available Irish stouts.

I don't quite know why, but I found it impossible to get the attention of either of the female bartenders.

Patrons to my left and right were being served, but the bartenders chose to ignore me, and would not even make eye contact. I started to wonder what I had done to put them off. Was it my thick Brooklyn accent, or was it my NHL NY Rangers t-shirt?

After what seemed like an eternity (15-20 min), a third bartender came over from the other bar and took my order. I drank my Murphy's (my favorite of the three) and left with the feeling that I was unwelcome."
"John Henchy & Sons",175,"Kevin Byrne",1413,"6 years ago",4,"This pub typifies a local bar in a city centre that still manages to retain some of the old world charm that is synonymous with the Irish pub scene of yesteryear. The decor and the friendly banter between staff and customer is something that would keep you coming back over and over. The establishment boasts lively music several nights of the week from well-known cork musicians. It is the type of place you can add easily go for an afternoon cup of coffee as a lovely night out depending on your mood. The owner is also particularly welcoming."

"Pa Johnson's",180,"Bob Koerner",351,"7 years ago",1,"What a dump.  It was the favorite hangout of our Irish friend from 30 years ago.  It has seen it's better days, if it every did.  We arrive about 10:30 in the evening, and the place was practically abandoned with only one patron at the bar.  Mercifully, they close shortly after, so we had our pint and moved along.  Maybe it's just for locals only."
"Pa Johnson's",180,"Steve Daly",2403,"6 years ago",3,"It started out as a nice quiet place. Myself and my friends had decided to stay after our first two pints, however it descended rapidly from that point on. A particularly noisy group of drinkers decided we would all enjoy their singing (shouting the words). The barman seemed unconcerned by this and dispite a number of people leaving, he didn't intervene. After about ten minutes of this noise we decided to leave the place although we all had almost full pints. A pity as it is a nice pub when quiet."
"Pa Johnson's",180,"u u",2550,"8 years ago",4,"I visited it because of The Accordion & Fiddle Club which meets there on the last Wednesday of every month.  Thoroughly enjoyed it... Amazing talent there & lovely tea and sandwiches served by the owners.. l was speaking to regulars there and they said it is a pretty lively and jolly place as a rule."
"Pa Johnson's",180,"Alan Foy",98,"a year ago",5,"A great bar just off the beaten track. A place where you can sit in peace or have a friendly chat as punters come and go. A gem."
"Pa Johnson's",180,"Tony Cogan",2526,"3 years ago",5,"A great place to enjoy a decent pint served by courteous and helpful staff.  An authentic and original bar that is a mainstay of life in Cork for both locals and tourists alike.  A must visit."
"Pa Johnson's",180,"John Barry",1248,"6 years ago",4,"Pa Johnson's is a true Cork City Pub. Barry is the 2nd generation and the pictures on the walls reflect the music life of the city from Rory Gallagher, who was a classmate, to the Dixies and beyond. It can be quiet but at times there is no better place in the city."
"Hungry Hippo Cork",181,"Gitta D√©vai",973,"2 months ago",5,"Fabulous place, I can only recommend.
The restaurant has a really good vibe and the sitting places are really comfortable. The staff is kind and helpful the prices are fair.
All in all, great place for a burger üçî, they also do take away."
"Hungry Hippo Cork",181,"Mary Cronin",1685,"4 months ago",5,"It was my first time visiting the Hungry Hippo and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere was great with fantastic decor. We were sat in a booth by the window which gave us loads of space. The food was fantastic and great value for money. We had chicken goujons and chips and we also got tortilla chips and salsa for the table which I thought was amazing while waiting for our food. The staff were also very nice and helpful throughout our visit. I would highly recommend."

"Hungry Hippo Cork",181,"christenor sanon",485,"5 months ago",1,"1st and Last Time

I ordered the Crunchy Bird with the hope of getting a solid burger  something that looked like what they proudly advertise in their pictures.
To my absolute horror, it wasn‚Äôt even close.

I‚Äôve had my fair share of burgers, and usually, if there‚Äôs an issue, it‚Äôs the meat. But this time? Everything was wrong. The chicken was hard  yes, hard. It‚Äôs chicken  how do you mess that up? Then came the bun: stale. Genuinely stale bread. That was a first for me. Like they say, there‚Äôs a first time for everything, lucky me, I guess.

And for a price tag of ‚Ç¨18, you‚Äôd expect the burger to be worth it, right? Wrong.
As for the fries? A soggy mess with the taste of ‚ÄúI might not have been ready to be eaten.‚Äù Completely lifeless.

The one saving grace to this whole horrifying experience was the chicken tenders. But that‚Äôs about it.

And the cherry on top? Their phone number. Doesn‚Äôt ring, just gives you an automated ‚Äútry again later‚Äù response. Translation: no accountability, no customer service, no care.

Please  save yourself the disappointment. Don‚Äôt make the mistake I did"

"Hungry Hippo Cork",181,"Mr Walsh",1829,"4 months ago",5,"I saw one review on here saying they don't even ask you how you like your burger cooked. This is asked with a steak order never in Ireland are you asked that about a burger it is cooked to the proper temperature not over done and cooked.

Well just off Washington Street a very filling meal to be enjoyed. I would recommend being fairly hungry when going to the hungry hippo as the meals burgers that are served are fresh filling and very large.

The wait time was surprisingly quick to say that the burger had to be cooked prepared and presented. It was filling fantast and delicious with just the right amount of side of chips for the large Crunchy Bird Burger ‚Ç¨17.00 Meal with the choice of chips or onion rings and a large glass of the inhouse homemade lemonade one of the tasiest drinks I had in a long time drinks costs extra.

For another ‚Ç¨3 you can add another side I went with the spare ribs and they were full of meat in a delicious sauce real meaty and tasty.

The staff are great making sure your experience is a good and enjoyable one. On certain days there are also meal deals to have. There is Plenty of seating inside. A bit pricey if ordering different foods and extras but great for sharing if ordering different meals.

Well worth dinning at the hungry hippo great staff fantastic filling food and an over all great experience."
"Hungry Hippo Cork",181,"Anshul Nama",239,"a month ago",3,"I ordered the triple smash burger and onion rings. My girlfriend ordered a vegan burger and fries. Both very average. Dessert was not good."
"Hungry Hippo Cork",181,"Alex Vetsch",127,"a month ago",5,"I barely do reviews but here I have to leave one. Growing up in a mostly vegetarian household; I often try vegan alternatives in restaurants, just because I'm curious how good they are.
I love meat as well to make those comparisons fair.
This has been so far the way best vegan alternative I've ever tried and oh boy I've tried em a lot!
Since they use big chuncks of cauliflower, the texture and bite is just perfect!
Got em with the buffalo sauce which is decent spicy, what you won't find often in Europe.
And they got Revolution beer as weel!
Don't miss this amazing place in Cork!"

The team was of great help and easily contactable to arrange all the details prior to our arrival. On the day, their helpfulness and efficiency allowed a smooth, excellent and enjoyable experience while taking care of our large group and staying attentive to our needs. The food was delicious and all our participants great enjoyed the evening with a wide range of food available.
This was my first time bringing them there, and I am happy to say it was a pure success. I highly recommend them and will definitely be back soon."

"Pompeii Pizza",182,"Scott Lee",2276,"6 months ago",5,"I you go to Franciscan Well for a beer (which I highly recommend) you gotta step out back and try one of Pompeii‚Äôs Pizzas. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the wood fire oven, a secret recipe or maybe just because you‚Äôre in Ireland but it‚Äôs some damn good pizza.
Couldn‚Äôt decide which to get so as I normally do, I asked the pizza man for his recommendation. Nduja, yea that‚Äôs the one. Little bit of spice or kick to it.
Sitting in Ireland drinking my Rebel Red and eating my wood fire oven pizza‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ chit man, life is good.
Give it a whirl and tell them the bald headed American sent ya!"
"Pompeii Pizza",182,"Philip Ziche",2052,"6 months ago",4,"Hidden away in the beer garden of the Franciscan Well pub is a great little pizza spot that deserves to be tried when in Cork! Choose one of the many options (that include veggie and vegan options), have a seat with your pint from the pub and wait until the buzzer rings. Simple and delicious! The crust had a nice chew and a lovely charred flavour which I really enjoyed!"
"Pompeii Pizza",182,"Silvia Canevelli",2334,"2 months ago",5,"Very nice place, full of space and flowers everywhere. There are no table service but the pizzas were very nice! We will sure come back!"
"Pompeii Pizza",182,"Sheryl Walpole",2328,"4 months ago",2,"Just had a pizza here. While it looked and sounded good it was the worst pizza I‚Äôve ever had. It was soft (I expected a crunchy base) and not properly cooked through. The cheese was tasteless. Very disappointing all round"
"Pompeii Pizza",182,"ronan ahern",2171,"3 months ago",1,"Feedback on delivery option. The pizza is poor to average at best, it fills a hunger gap but very careless approach to preparing the pizza. The toppings are carelessly prepared and the cheese is not spread on the pizza. I order regularly out of poor availability of good pizza in cork city but its the same every time. Some quality control would go along way as it was a lot better a few years ago ü´†"
"Pompeii Pizza",182,"Cristina Gismondi",578,"a year ago",2,"nice location , pizza and beer are always a good combination. however, do not go here if you are vegan. they make their own vegan cheese so this sounded nice and after seeing reviews I was quite looking forward to it. went with a friend and we got two pizzas, shared half the pulled jackfruit option and half a margherita.
The whole texture of the cheese was wrong and was as if it was dolloped onto the pizzas , making globs that would nearly flop off the slices when picking them up. I started just letting them roll off so my stomach wouldn‚Äôt turn any further eating the slices..if I had a knife I would‚Äôve spread the cheese balls over the pizza cause the overall taste was nice in the cheese and the sauce. the base was great // cooked well.
Please just find a different way to apply that cheese to the vegan pizzas ..I will not be back, but for future customers, please do them a favour."
"Pompeii Pizza",182,"Frank Cawley",904,"3 months ago",5,"Great pizza ordering process is complicated it can take 30 minutes to get your pizza but luckily it's located in the Franciscan well brewery so you can challenge a few pints of wheat beers while your waiting for the wheat pizza"
"Pompeii Pizza",182,"Mark Mirigian",1659,"2 years ago",5,"Excellent thin crust, wood fired pizza. They have several pizza options including margherita and bianca as well as a create-your-own pizza.

"Pompeii Pizza",182,"Cindy Kingston",517,"2 months ago",5,"Very busy pizza kitchen at the Franciscan Well Brewery. Lively and busy atmosphere when visited midweek in summer. Very good pizza with great flavoursone toppings, but you have to get into a queue to order."
"The Garden Cafe",1,"Zarko Roncevic",2649,"a year ago",5,"This little coffee shop is a total hidden gem in the city, surrounded by greenery and super relaxing. The staff are really friendly, and it's perfect whether you‚Äôre soaking up the sun outside or staying cozy indoors on a rainy day. My fianc√© and I had an amazing breakfast here on a sunny morning, and the whole vibe was just perfect. Plus, it‚Äôs nonprofit and all about horticulture, which makes it even more special. Definitely worth checking out!"
"Izz Cafe",183,"Ahmed Mohsen",71,"2 months ago",5,"I had lunch at Izz Cafe and the food was delicious. I started with the tasters mix ‚Äî a flavorful appetizer that is perfect for sharing (up to 4 people maybe). It had a nice variety of spreads, specially the Babaganoush and beetroot hummus, with rich flavors and tasted great when paired with the restaurant's fresh and soft bread. I ordered the Magloubeh for the main dish and it had a nice mix of ingredients and spices. The portion was also decent. I recommend making a reservation in advance to avoid waiting times, which can be long, because the place is usually full."
"Izz Cafe",183,"Grace Donoghue",985,"2 months ago",5,"Amazing array of authentic food. The decor and interior design is inspiring. It hasnt got a liquor license, which is important to bear in mind. The platter for three easily fed five of us."
"Izz Cafe",183,"Kevin Pallotti",1434,"3 months ago",5,"For the last two years, I've been protesting on behalf of, and donating to, Palestinian families in Gaza.

When I found out about your caf√© I immediately added it to my family's itinerary for our Ireland visit this summer. My Mother, Father, and I visited your caf√© for dinner this evening at my urging. I am thrilled to say this lived up to the hype. We thoroughly enjoyed the Taster's Plate, Chicken Mousaken, and Beef lamb. The Palestinian coffee was exceptional. We especially loved the Warbat. So sweet and flaky. You lived up to the hype! I wish you all the best. It was a real pleasure."
"Izz Cafe",183,"keerthi m nair",1394,"2 months ago",5,"Izz Caf√© offers a fantastic introduction to authentic Palestinian cuisine.

"Sakura Cuisine",184,"Kevin F",1417,"Edited a month ago",4,"Usually don‚Äôt make repeat stops on trips but Sakura Cuisine hit the spot.   Maybe it was the perfect contrast to eating Irish cuisine for many days in a row.  Then again maybe it was their solid formula of kind service and lovely interior.  Well done!

Came in for late night take out and were lucky to be served to kindly and courteously.     The ramen, gyoza, and udon were all good.  Would go back and eat in next time as the space is very inviting for a meal."

"Sakura Cuisine",184,"Samuel Howard",2230,"2 weeks ago",5,"I honestly don't know how this rating isn't higher. I had the Gyoza Ramen and it was bold and silky. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the vegetables were delicious. My wife had the Eel roll, the tamago, the salmon (amazing as she said), and the spicy tuna. We didn't expect the spicy tuna to be quite that spicy, but still delicious. The cuts of meat were all top notch. The service was on top of it and we felt very welcomed."
"Sakura Cuisine",184,"Ksenia Gera",1455,"8 months ago",3,"The restaurant is beautiful, we took sushi and noodles and both dishes were authentic Japanese. For dessert I ordered cheesecake, it looked just perfect, but after taking a bite I realized that it was just a piece of ice. I asked to change it. They brought the same piece of ice. This means that the desserts are not freshly prepared, but taken out of the freezer. I really didn‚Äôt like this. Everything else is great."

On this street there are many places to eat. They are all very busy! Sakura is not a place I imagine will be noisy at any hour, it is very peaceful.

I will also recommend Catching Fire for people who hate sushi ""because it's raw fish"". The salmon is cooked so I'm sure anyone will enjoy it!"
"Lulu's @ the Lough",185,"Captain Figgy",417,"a month ago",5,"Really nice cafe and great deal for a√ßai lovers. An a√ßai bowl (that you get to pick the contents of) and ANY coffee for ‚Ç¨12. The a√ßai is nice but not a strong flavour so that may be a deterrent for some. Coffee is good enough and they are generous with syrup. The toastie is one of the cheapest in cork (‚Ç¨5.50-‚Ç¨6.50) and it is nice quality. The cafe is dog friendly which is great especially if you‚Äôre walking at the lough. Would recommend!"
"Lulu's @ the Lough",185,"J Cronin",1108,"6 months ago",5,"This is an absolutely beautiful coffee shop in a perfect location alongside the lough while being impeccably clean and charming too.

"Lulu's @ the Lough",185,"Rumenigo Fernandes",2194,"3 months ago",1,"I‚Äôve visited Lulu‚Äôs Caf√© a couple of times, mostly when I‚Äôve had my car in for servicing nearby. It‚Äôs a lovely spot, with great coffee, tasty food, and usually a warm and welcoming vibe. I even came here about a year ago under the same circumstances and had a very pleasant experience.

This time, I arrived around 10 AM, let the staff know I‚Äôd be working for a few hours, and ordered breakfast with a coffee. I was seated at a table for two and planned to stay through lunch, fully intending to order again.

Unfortunately, around noon, what I believe was the owner approached me and spoke in a way that was unnecessarily loud and frankly quite humiliating. He made a point‚Äîwithin earshot of other customers‚Äîthat I was taking up space and not spending enough, even though I had already ordered and had clearly communicated I‚Äôd be staying for lunch. The tone and manner were extremely uncomfortable and made me feel very unwelcome.

It‚Äôs disappointing when a place you‚Äôve appreciated for its quality turns into a space where you‚Äôre made to feel like a burden rather than a customer. While the caf√© itself is great, I hope management reflects on how they approach and communicate with infrequent customers."

I've been trying to go to this place for over four months and it was worth all the wait. I can't wait to go back and I recommend it to everyone. As a good Brazilian, I love meat.

"Elbow Lane Brew and Smoke House",186,"Mark Purchase",1665,"4 months ago",5,"Booked here for Monday 2 June, a Bank Holiday in Ireland. It was fully booked apart from two seats at the bar which we took

The place is small, but the atmosphere is buzzing helped by the open fire pit where the chefs cook the meat

The micro brewery makes excellent beers, especially nice pale ales both of which I tried

We had smoked beetroot with whipped wasabi cheese and pork belly with a spicy caramel glaze for starters followed by 2 beautifully cooked rib eye steaks along with the deep fried mushrooms

The food was terrific, the service great and we finished off with two cocktails instead of dessert

Not cheap, but well worth it"
"Elbow Lane Brew and Smoke House",186,"Jake Higgins",1136,"6 months ago",5,"Okay, I can see what the rave reviews are about. I'm always a little skeptical when somewhere is rated THIS highly, but they have matched it.

The aroma as you walk in starts everything off right, and while the menu is limited, it is limited to what they do best. The service was excellent and attentive and everything fit nicely into the experience. DO make a booking as it is only small inside, with one gripe being the the tables could be a little bigger but space is at a premium."

Walking in, I was impressed with how lovely the place looked. The d√©cor is modern and stylish, giving it a welcoming atmosphere that makes you want to sit and enjoy your meal.

The staff were pleasant and polite throughout my visit, though I did feel they could have been a little more attentive at times. Nothing major, but small details, like checking in more often or being quicker with service would have made the experience feel that bit smoother.

As for the food, the eggs Benedict was nicely presented and the portion size was just right for a brunch dish. The salmon was fresh, and the eggs were cooked well, though personally I found the overall flavour quite salty, which took away slightly from the enjoyment.

The orange juice was delicious and tasted freshly squeezed, but at ‚Ç¨4.50 for a small glass, it did feel overpriced compared to the rest of the meal.

Overall, it was a pleasant first experience. I‚Äôd recommend."

The price varied from day to day for the same meal.  The first day it cost 13.95 as I later learned that they had charged me for two eggs that  I didn't order. The second time the amount of haloumi was minimal and that cost 11.50 with one slice of toast and the third time there was a decent amount of haloumi which cost 11.95.  Somebody needs to look at their pricing which varies from day to day.  The staff were very nice and the atmosphere was good however and the place is very clean."

"Cameron Bakery",190,"Scholastica Ighas",2274,"a month ago",2,"I normally get banana bread and it‚Äôs been so nice. However they didn‚Äôt have any today and I got a croissant. This croissant tasted stale and as though it‚Äôs been left out in the air for so long. I told the staffs who insisted they got it fresh every morning and offered no exchange or refund.

Had to bin it in the store as I could barely gulp it in or manage it.

I‚Äôve been a customer so I hope this is taken as a constructive criticism.

"Boojum",339,"Emma Healy",817,"3 months ago",2,"Got a takeaway burrito which was cold, even though I ate it 5 minutes later. Small portion and they upcharge for almost any extras like meat, guacamole,  pickled onions, etc. I guess if you ordered a veggie burrito with no add-ons it would be somewhat reasonable in price but it quickly goes up even to just get meat. Besides the poor value, small portion and cold temperature,  it was genuinely one of  the most flavourless meals I've ever had. Disappointing, as they used to be fairly ok."

To be completely honest, I was already feeling uneasy after being yelled at by a stranger in the market just for taking a couple of minutes to find my wallet. I hoped this caf√© would offer a little comfort ‚Äî instead, it made everything worse.
From the moment I walked in, I felt an overwhelming tension in the air. The woman behind the counter, who appeared older and visibly stressed, made the whole atmosphere unbearable. Rather than feeling welcomed, I felt like a burden ‚Äî as if my mere presence was an inconvenience. There was absolutely no warmth, no smile, no hint of hospitality.
I ordered a wrap, hoping for something simple and satisfying. What I got looked and tasted like it had been made in another decade ‚Äî stale, dry, and lifeless. Nothing inside was fresh. Honestly, it felt like a cruel joke.
If you're looking for a quiet moment to enjoy a good meal and relax, this is the last place you should go. Between the cold service and the terrible food, this experience turned a bad day into something much worse."

"Shake Dog",191,"Mr Walsh",1829,"4 months ago",4,"A great alternative to the bigger fast food takeaway restaurants. I would say Shake dog has a lot more variety and choice to choose from. The Hawaiian Burger was delicious and very filling. The staff are very helpful and friendly and hard working. Giving that extra bit of service that you do not get in other fast food takeaways.  It is spacious with plenty of seating for all and good for large groups or even if you just want to drop in yourself. Great selection of burger meals and tastefully cooked. The price was reasonably affordable at ‚Ç¨12.95. The only reason it did not get 5 stars was because of the small portion of chips a few more extra chips and this would be well up there for value. As for now it is a great place to visit and very affordable for what is served big delicious tasty burgers by attentive staff.would definitely recommend and will call back in again."
"Shake Dog",191,"Eduardo Alday",765,"a month ago",5,"We came here to eat because of the meal deal that they have and the combo was super good. Hamburger plus fries and milkshake for 10 euros.

Remember going to these places 10 years ago or so with my family when it was Eddie Rockets and it was very nice but clearly no one in these places care any more.

The cheese on my chips tasted like molten play dough on my chips.

Overall thoughts: Yocky"
"Shake Dog",191,"Rachel C",2080,"6 months ago",1,"Unfortunately this place has really gone downhill, used to be one of our favourite spots in the city for food.

They‚Äôve gone really scaldy with the milkshakes- only fill it 3 quarters of the way now (and they‚Äôve changed the flavor of the vanilla milkshake?!?!)

All the portion sizes are way smaller- the chips are tiny too. Between the table of 4 of us, there was a burger, breakfast and tenders and none of us really liked our meals.

I got the breakfast and didn‚Äôt eat half of it- I got about 6 baked beans!üòÇüòÇ a mouse would be pissed if he only got 6 scaldy beans. The rashers were inedible, the eggs were just bad. The toast was barely toasted.

Also, the waiter was just so not bothered whatsoever. None of the staff were nice to be honest, could be the bosses fault, who knows.

Unfortunately won‚Äôt be back which is a pity, as it used to be great"

"Shake Dog",191,"Nat",1849,"3 weeks ago",1,"I decided to visit Shake Dog after hearing good things about it, but I left feeling extremely disappointed with the overall experience. From the beginning, the restaurant did not meet the standard I was expecting. The portion sizes were surprisingly small and not reflective of the price charged. The food itself was poorly prepared, tasted processed, and lacked freshness. Unfortunately, we could not finish our meals due to both the unpleasant taste and presentation.

What made matters worse was the attitude of the manager. Rather than being welcoming or professional, they came across as impolite and dismissive. At one point, we were even charged more than what we had ordered, and only after raising the issue was the mistake reluctantly corrected. This left a very negative impression of both the management and the establishment‚Äôs approach to customer service.

In terms of value, the pricing is excessive for what is essentially frozen, low-quality food. The limited selection of drinks only added to the disappointment. The restaurant‚Äôs cleanliness was also far below acceptable standards. I noticed stains on the walls, spills that hadn‚Äôt been cleaned, and even ketchup marks on the ceiling. The overall environment felt neglected and unhygienic, which made it uncomfortable to sit and eat.

The customer service did nothing to improve the situation. Staff seemed disinterested and unengaged, and there was no effort to make customers feel welcomed or looked after. Given the lack of quality in the food, the poor service, and the unsanitary atmosphere, I cannot recommend Shake Dog. I left not only dissatisfied but also with an upset stomach, which further confirms the poor quality of the food being served.

This experience was highly disappointing from start to finish. I will not be returning, and I would strongly advise others to consider alternative dining options that value both their customers and the quality of the food they serve."
"Shake Dog",191,"Beatriz Garcez",315,"2 years ago",5,"Very nice place, the North American retro decoration caught my attention. The prices are good. You can have the ‚Äúshake dog deal‚Äù that includes one burger, one side and one shake for ‚Ç¨10. You have to pay at the register on your way out. They also have delivery and take away. We had the smoking veggie Burguer and the cheese burger and they were delicious. The chips comes with the sauce within it and with cheese on the top, also very good. The shakes were also nice but we ordered the Nutella one and it could have a bit more Nutella on it."
"Shake Dog",191,"Karolina Dziedzic",1360,"a month ago",1,"This used to be an absolute gem a few years ago. What used to be a signature full to the brim milkshake with a huge amount of cream on top spilling over with chunks of oreo etc, turned to a 2/3 full glass with INSANELY watered down milkshake, where all you taste is whipped cream with a tiny bit of flavour.

Waited 30+ mins while the venue was super quiet, only to be give a hot dog and burger which were both extremely plain, zero flavour. We weren't the only ones unhappy with the food either, two groups left their food unfinished and the other complained about their orders being wrong.

So sad and disappointing, it used to be fantastic. Effort used to be put in, not anymore. Whatever new management did is not good at all."

The surroundings are ideal for small groups to meet as there is a series of small snug compartments as well as, of course, the traditional bar which is the centerpiece and where you can have a few quiet pints of your own or connect for a chat with whoever happens to be around. It is old school. Lots of timber. The food menu centers on pizza. At my table we asked for four different options. Everyone was very happy. I recomend the Mexican!

"Reiwa Japanese Restaurant",194,"Lucas Raiol",1561,"a month ago",4,"The food was well-prepared and tasty, but I feel like the staff could be a bit more patient and not so anxious.

We got there on a Tuesday, right after the restaurant had just opened and the place was empty. The waiter gave us the menu and, not even 3 minutes later he came back asking if we were ready to order. We also ordered one appetizer and two main dishes and the appetizer came 5 minutes after the main dishes.

Food-wise, the Chicken Katsu Curry Don was pretty good, but I feel the balance between the rice and the curry could be a bit better. There was too much rice for the amount of curry on the dish.

My partner really enjoyed her Aburi Salmon Don.

The highlight was the Tori Karaage, which was incredibly tasty and the sauce that comes with complemented well the dish.

"Reiwa Japanese Restaurant",194,"Estere B",851,"6 months ago",1,"We ordered 1 starter to share and 2 main dishes (2 people).
The waitress brings our starter (8 pcs chicken wings) with a tray, and while picking up the plate, she dropped all the pieces of chicken on the ‚Äú‚Äùdirty‚Äù‚Äù tray. Instead of brining it back to the kitchen she just picked up the chicken one by one with her HANDS and put it back on the plate and served it to us. I‚Äôve never had this happen to me in a restaurant..
While ordering I had specified to bring the starter first and then the mains. My girlfriend‚Äôs main arrived 2 minutes after the starter was served.. Mine arrived 10 minutes after that.. so not even at the same time..
As a result the food was half cold when we got to it.

The service is great, they are very friendly and always with smiles, it‚Äôs not a big restaurant but the design is good even you sit close to the door, you won‚Äôt feel cold or annoyed by the noise opening and closing the door. At last solutes to the chef, you are doing amazing job! A customer from Dublin."
"Reiwa Japanese Restaurant",194,"Hillary Paulino",1051,"3 weeks ago",1,"We ordered sushi here and waited over 40 minutes. We asked the server and he was unconcerned as he said it would be here soon. It did not come soon. We asked the waitress again and she said ‚ÄúA lot of sushi orders came in when you ordered‚Äù as though that was a legitimate excuse. It wasn‚Äôt even busy. Then she had the nerve to suggest we order appetisers while we waited to make up for the fact that our food hadn‚Äôt arrived?! Make it make sense.

After so long, we asked to pay for our pitifully small teapot of green tea and leave. The waitress responded to us leaving the restaurant without eating due to waiting so long with ‚ÄúI‚Äôd do the same if I was you.‚Äù That is so unprofessional? It was unbelievable.

Would not recommend this incompetent restaurant that can‚Äôt deal with more than one table at a time. Stay away."
"Filter Espresso and Brew Bar",195,"Kelly Irwin",1401,"2 weeks ago",5,"Stopped by this coffee shop this morning for a cortado and something to go ‚Äî and wow!

Staff are friendly
You can get decent hot chocolate if you don‚Äôt want coffee
Nice selection of treats and pastries on offer daily

It‚Äôs a cashless shop so card only
Few seats at the window so predominately takeaway
Wheelchair and buggy accessible but it‚Äôs a tight space
They also have some coffee related products for sale
Would recommend for takeaway"
"Filter Espresso and Brew Bar",195,"Ana Paula Campos",185,"5 months ago",1,"I visited the caf√© this morning (04/05) and had a disappointing experience with the customer service.

We needed either vegetarian or a halal food. There was a smash burger place which we really wanted to try but there were no burgers left,  the burger stall directed us to Dips.

We were not disappointed. We ordered a Korean chicken dish, 2 x Malaysian chicken noodles and a beef curry. The food was fantastic. Good portion sizes and was very tasty.

The service was fantastic.
Good variety of dishes to choose from. A touch expensive but feel Cork is an expensive place.

Highly recommend."
"Dips",198,"Soumendu Ghosh",2368,"Edited 2 months ago",4,"The Massaman curry was very good and I did expect that considering the crew are from Malaysia. Other items are good as well and the seafood seemed fresh.

One thing I did not like is the serving bowls, it is quite hard to eat from it. Hope they can change it to something tried and tested.

Overall would recommend for east Asian food in the black market."

However, there was one issue: the outdoor tables at the caf√© are reserved for walk-ins and cannot be booked. Since we couldn't reserve one, we booked a table inside. When we arrived, we noticed many empty tables outside and asked if we could move, as it was a beautiful sunny day. Unfortunately, we were told that since we had already booked an indoor table, we couldn't switch to an outdoor one, even though several were available ( in and out side)"

They make thee best chips in Cork. Yup, I said it. They make the best chips in Cork.

Their chips are seasoned with something spicy. The spiciness is just right. You get a slight hit of salt with them as well.

The guys here are incredibly friendly and helpful.  They will make sure that you get what you want and more.

There is plenty of seating in The Black Market. They have wheelchair accessible tables and toilets. You can bring your pets.

It is a difficult balance to make thin crust Neapolitan style crusts and pile on the toppings but these two pizzas were on point.

Freezing cold, inedible, I threw it away because I felt sick eating it. Expensive mistake going here.

"Palmento",199,"Eoin Connolly",832,"5 years ago",1,"Absolutely avoid. Ordered 2 portions of chips and a pizza and one coke. In total it was ‚Ç¨30+
Food arrived after over an hour. The chips were cold, hard and leathery. But the pizza was even worse. Ordered one with several meats and cheese etc. The pizza had 3 or 4 tiny pieces of meat. The rest was mostly base sauce and bits of cheese. 30 quid for disappointment.
We called to complain and to be fair they did send a second one. The staff and delivery driver were very nice... BUT...
That second pizza was just as bad, if not even worse. Again, very few toppings and the pizza was falling apart. Leaking off the base.You would think that a replacement one would be somewhat better considering. It's like the chef is trying to get fired or something.
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Two attempts in one, and both were horrific."

The Caesar Salad was a whole chicken snitchel and some lettuce. We had to ask for more lettuce and we‚Äôre not usually the kind of people to do that. Eggs Benedict was amazing, as was the Buddha Bowl, though ‚Ç¨4 extra for chicken seems a bit much. French Toast was great, no issues.
Biggest issue is that there didn‚Äôt seem to be enough staff but that is understandable at the moment.

It is a stroke of good fortune for Cork that with this great chef's presence, you have the opportunity to savor the most exquisite Japanese delicacies.

I feel compelled to share this: most of the low-scoring reviews do not truly apprehend the soul of Japanese cuisine‚Äîthey are, in fact, strangers to its depths. This is hardly just or reverent. For those unacquainted, abstaining from critique or choosing not to patronize would be more graceful than feigning expertise.

I cherish this establishment through every iteration of its journey, and I hold in the highest regard the chef‚Äôs profound dedication to the delicate art of creating exquisite culinary masterpieces.

I earnestly wish that the quality of reviews by Cork‚Äôs residents might be uplifted. Let us transcend ignorance and subjectivity, and refrain from offering casual critiques. While sharing your experiences, please honor the meticulous efforts of the restaurant with due respect."

The udon butter soup was good but I did not find Japanese taste in it. The rice and grilled salmon were very boring and not tasty.

"Ichigo Ichie Bistro and Natural Wine",201,"Katherine D",1380,"a week ago",2,"This restaurant is an airless casual wine & soba bar, not a fine-dining, high-end Japanese restaurant. No sashimi, sushi, or really anything that we were expecting.

I reserved for the ""main bar counter,"" about a month in advance as it is advertised as a chef's counter. It is instead a server station/overflow space where all we witnessed was three gals struggling to pour a pint.

Menus are cheap paper with a long (tiny printed) specials board listed on a chalkboard. It is recommended to take a photo of these specials on your phone & ""zoom in."" We were not walked through anything despite saying it was our first time. I have never been asked to take a photo of something at an upscale restaurant in my life. Service was poor. Food was boring and expensive. For a bistro with a long list of specials, I would have expected to hear about a few of them. And for a wine bar, maybe a pairing could have been suggested.

I would have rather spent our night in Cork anywhere else."
"Ichigo Ichie Bistro and Natural Wine",201,"Nakyeong Kim",1844,"a year ago",4,"I had heard this place used to be an omakase restaurant, but it seems the concept has changed.

We were lucky enough to secure a table on the day of our booking.

We ordered the miso katsu, tofu, both hot and cold soba, and tendon. While it was enjoyable to have a taste of authentic Japanese cuisine, the flavors were quite basic. These are dishes you‚Äôd typically find for about ‚Ç¨4-5 in Japan.

The hot soba was overly salty, though the cold version was much better. The miso katsu was the standout dish, and the tendon was also quite nice, though I felt the topping could have been more. Additionally, in Japan, tendon usually comes with a sauce over the rice, which was missing here.

Overall, I‚Äôm still happy to return, and it‚Äôs worth giving this place a try."
"Ichigo Ichie Bistro and Natural Wine",201,"G W",912,"3 months ago",2,"I‚Äôve been a loyal customer since the original Michelin-starred Ichigo Ichie, and I‚Äôve returned six times since it transitioned to a bistro. Sadly, I have to say the experience has become consistently disappointing ‚Äî especially in terms of service.

The food is fine ‚Äî average at best ‚Äî but my expectations have always been shaped by the excellence of Miyazaki, the owner‚Äôs other restaurant, which continues to deliver exceptional food and truly warm, professional service.

At Ichigo Ichie Bistro, however, the service is consistently cold, inattentive, and at times even rude. For a restaurant at this price point, that‚Äôs simply unacceptable ‚Äî I‚Äôve received much better treatment in far more casual places.

What happened tonight made me finally write this review. When I politely pointed out that there was a bug in my wine, the staff dismissed it as ‚Äúsediment.‚Äù When I asked for a fresh glass, it was served with visible tissue paper residue on the rim. When I raised that concern, the server responded with an eye roll, which completely ruined our evening.

I‚Äôve tried to give this place many chances out of respect and past loyalty ‚Äî especially as a regular at Miyazaki. But unfortunately, tonight made it clear that the real issue isn‚Äôt the wine ‚Äî it‚Äôs the attitude of the staff.

I truly hope the team reflects on this. Cork deserves better from a restaurant with this heritage.

"Ichigo Ichie Bistro and Natural Wine",201,"Rebecca L",2096,"2 months ago",2,"Before visiting Ireland, I did research on restaurants in Cork and I booked this Japanese restaurant weeks ahead because it is recommended by the Michelin guide, has positive reviews on Google and the food photos look great too.
I have visited Michelin starred omakase restaurants in Tokyo, Kyoto and Fukuoka, and I would always book counter seating as it is usually where the actions take place. With this idea, I booked counter seating for me and my companion. Upon arrival, we were surprised to see that there was no chef behind the bar, not even a bartender‚Ä¶ the chef came out twice but avoided eye-contact with us, which I found odd as it would be seen as rude in Japan.
When we were given the menu, we were surprised not to see any sushi/ sashimi on it because we saw it in the photos on Google. My friend asked the waitress and she said they used to serve it, but now they no longer serve it. From the reviews and photos, we were misled to believe that it is a fine-dining restaurant, so it was a disappointment to see only soba/ udon/ donburi, all the standard fare in most Japanese restaurants.
We ordered a duck dish to share, which was quite big but slightly chewy. My tempura soba was ok but the broth was too salty for my taste. However, my companion was very upset about her Karaage don because she said that her rice was soggy. Rice is crucial in Japanese cuisine, so this is basic stuff, and yet they did not get it right. The ambience was not lively even on Sat eve, though the staff were friendly, it was a disappointing dinner for us as we had high hopes for this place. Out of all the restaurants we visited around Ireland in 2 weeks, this was one of our least favourite and I think people need to check out their recent photos/ reviews rather than the ones left 5-6 years ago as it has changed immensely since."
"Ichigo Ichie Bistro and Natural Wine",201,"S Chan",2206,"5 months ago",2,"A deeply disappointing dining experience ‚Äî not recommended.

This was, unfortunately, one of the worst dining experiences I‚Äôve had in Ireland. The issues started immediately upon arrival ‚Äî despite having a reservation, no staff greeted or guided us to our table. With only two other tables occupied throughout our entire visit, it was unclear why we were asked to arrive at the oddly specific time of 5:15.

We were placed at a bar counter that had no activity whatsoever ‚Äî no bartender, no food prep ‚Äî just an empty, static space. Strangely, we were squeezed next to two other guests with plenty of open seating elsewhere, making the experience feel unnecessarily cramped.

The restaurant doesn‚Äôt offer a set menu ‚Äî everything is √† la carte ‚Äî which made the rigid 5:15 or 9:00 p.m. booking slots seem arbitrary. The ambiance was also disappointing: loud music and a noisy environment that didn‚Äôt remotely reflect the serene or refined atmosphere you might expect from a Japanese dining experience.

What stood out most ‚Äî and not in a good way ‚Äî was one of the servers talking loudly and non-stop to the guests beside us. Her voice dominated the entire space, making it nearly impossible for us to have any conversation of our own. We had come for a special occasion, and instead, spent the evening feeling frustrated and unable to enjoy the moment.

The food and drinks were average at best. While the pricing wasn‚Äôt outrageous, the overall quality did not justify the cost. And as a final note: don‚Äôt bother dressing up ‚Äî the restaurant allows people in flip-flops, which really takes away from any sense of occasion. If you arrive dressed for a nice evening out, you‚Äôll likely feel awkward and out of place.

One last detail: if you're aiming for an authentic Japanese experience, please don‚Äôt serve sake in whiskey tumblers ‚Äî it felt careless and out of place.

Overall, this was a missed opportunity and not somewhere I would return or recommend."
"Ichigo Ichie Bistro and Natural Wine",201,"shalu kumaravel",2312,"a year ago",4,"We went for for a special occasion in September. Wanted to go here last year when they had a michelin star- their menu and over experience was different. Unfortunately couldn‚Äôt. This year they changed the entire set up and menu. Small and cozy place. They have special menu for the day like 5 starter and mains apart from their regular menu which i liked. Their regular menu had limited options. They offer high quality food. I personally loved the sushi in their special menu and the dessert matcha panacotta. Others were also good. But i felt like their take away restaurant Miyazaki had more options- i liked it better for it. If you are going to for drinks, they have a bar set up which was nice"
"Ichigo Ichie Bistro and Natural Wine",201,"Chaplin shiu",453,"a year ago",1,"The price and quality are very disappointing. The UNAGI YANAGAWA, which is too salty and you can‚Äôt taste the original flavor of the eel. It was different from what I tried in Kyushu. The TENZERU SOBA soup is too salty, and the soba noodles are also too soft. The fried prawns are not up to standard. I can‚Äôt believe this is authentic Japanese food! I also lived in Japan for almost two years, and it was really disappointing!

The service was also very poor. Because it was a birthday dinner, we ordered a bottle of wine. We were told that we could only dine for 90 minutes that day. We exceeded it by about 10 minutes, but our wine was not finished yet. The waiter kept rushing us. Secondly, it was disappointing to see that another table, arriving at the same time as ours, was not rushed while we felt hurried. It created a negative experience for us.

I strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT due to the steep price of their service and food."

"Naturally Nourished",202,"Niall O'Connor",1876,"2 years ago",3,"Nice location, friendly staff, great selection of food and not too expensive but the dish that I ordered had way too much hot sauce which made me feel sick at the end. It doesn't look that bad in the photo but there was even more sauce underneath the chicken. Felt like I was having sauce with a salad rather than the other way around. To be fair my sister said I should have gone up and asked for a replacement which I didn't so giving it 3 stars as the person preparing might have just gone a bit wild on the sauce by accident."

"Naturally Nourished",202,"Helen O' Connell",1040,"5 months ago",1,"Phoned on behalf of my company to order from lunch Menu where we would collect ourselves the next day! Initally after taking my name, company and phone number my order was placed by a very pleasant young man who informed me he was also manning the coffee machine. Wished to pre-pay and was asked by said young man that he would pass me to his Manager, waited and was then advised no orders could be taken for the next day, they were fully booked! Sounded like she was fobbing me off.... Hung up.... what if i had rocked up like i did a few months ago and ordered same from daily menu, for the same number of people? would I have been treated in the same manner? Sounded like said Manager could not be bothered when I spoke to her.

Very out dated that one unable to order and pay on-line.

We were able to order from competitor and pay on-line plus choose a pick-up time, seamless, professional and friendly, most importantly were delighted with the business we put their way.

Naturally Nourished felling very 'unnaturally nourished'  and 'disappointed', won't ever order from you or recommend you in the future either professionally or personally.

Alex and his team cultivated a phenomenal dining experience in this amazing and frankly underrated establishment. From the service, to the delicious food, to the warmth of the servers personality, this place is a cork gem. From the minute we walked in they proceeded to create an unforgettable atmosphere around us, from their singing and dancing we laughed and rejoiced as a group.

We were greeted by a friendly member of FOH, she took our order not long after arrival. Initially our starters and son's pizza came out first which was suggested by the member of staff. This was great and we enjoyed the beef cheek and beet on goats. Both starters were presented and tasted amazing. Other groups/couples started to come into the restaurant. We were now waiting on 2 pizzas. Tables who came in and ordered after us were receiving their orders and we were still waiting. It took 40 minutes from when we got our starters before we got our remaining 2 pizzas. We called the same member of staff over and made her aware we were waiting a long time. She did kindly bring over a portion of chips for our son and another coke as we were waiting so long.
We got the 2 pizza which again tasted amazing, we had some left over which we wanted to take away in a box. After we received our pizza no member of staff checked in on us. We waited again. Tired of waiting I carried my plate up to pay and have the remaining food boxed up. A gentleman met us at the till ,took the pizza to be boxed up and gave us our bill. I was prepared to give feedback on our experience how ever he never asked us how was our food/experience etc. The opportunity to give feedback wasn't there. We paid, he thanked us and we left.

I was not disappointed. The place looked and smelled amazing.
I was seated by the kitchen so I could see the chefs busy at work. The head chef was very friendly and said if I needed any advice just ask. The waitress was also very friendly and with hers and the head chefs advice I went with the Dingle Bay wild squid for the starter which was amazing and such a good portion, possibly the best portion of deep fried squid I've had before. For the main I went with one of the specials, monkfish wrapped in pancetta with scallops. Oh my god that meal was amazing and well worth the ‚Ç¨38 for that course. By the end I had hardly any room left so I just had a single scoop of ice cream.

Overall the staff and food were amazing. Thanks again to the head chef for being so friendly and informative."

"Quinlans Seafood Bar Cork",208,"Carrie Guo",440,"a month ago",3,"I noticed this seafood restaurant was pretty popular, so I stopped by for lunch. I ordered a half seafood chowder and a half sandwich, but the portions were much smaller than I expected. The menu said the sandwich could be shrimp or smoked salmon, but the shrimp was sold out, so no choice there. Luckily, the smoked salmon was really good‚Äîdefinitely a nice surprise!

The seafood chowder, even as a half portion, was tiny and way too salty. I usually love seafood chowder, but this one was a bit overpowering.

The service wasn‚Äôt great either. I asked for a recommendation, and the server seemed impatient and cold. Even when other customers sat nearby, the same cold, short attitude continued. Really a shame."

"Quinlans Seafood Bar Cork",208,"Melanie Tam",1736,"a month ago",3,"I had Quinlan's Seafood Bar bookmarked because I wanted to try some seafood while in Ireland, and it was near our hotel. It's hard to go out to dinner when you've been out exploring all day, and have a jetlagged 8 month-old. So we decided to order for take-out. We had:

-Homemade Seafood Chowder (chunks of fresh & smoked fish, prawns and mussels with diced vegetables in a seafood cream sauce and served with brown bread) - too salty, but the brown bread really helped
-Traditional Beer Battered Fish and Chips (with real potato chips served with a lemon wedge & tartar sauce, homemade mushy peas & curry sauce) - this wasn't bad but I wouldn't recommend it for takeout
-Pan-fried Filet of Seabass (pan fried fillets of sea bass with shrimp and mussels' risotto, white wine, marinated tomatoes & pea shoots) - the seabass was good, but the risotto was very salty

Overall, it seems like the seafood is pretty fresh but they are heavy-handed on the salt here. I think a dine-in experience would have been much better - just be sure to tell them to go light on the salt."
"Quinlans Seafood Bar Cork",208,"Chris B",472,"4 months ago",4,"Food was excellent and the staff were very friendly.

I had the calamari to start and a red mullet and scallop main course. With dessert and a coffee. The service was quick and the food was served quickly. Delicious seafood."
"Quinlans Seafood Bar Cork",208,"Rhonda Barry",2116,"4 months ago",5,"We ordered seafood chowder entrees, amazing.
We then had wanted something we had seen online, scallops and monkfish but apparently this had been on a previous specials menu and was not now available.
Our backup choice was scallops and white pudding which was on the starter's menu. They kindly upsized for us and we had with a delicious salad and chips.
Wow, drool. Expensive but well worth it.
10/10."

"Oak Fire Pizza - Princes Street",209,"Alice Leonard",143,"6 months ago",5,"Made the mistake of looking at reviews online before coming here, it meant we already had our pizzas eyed up and particularly the breadsticks, it all amounted to a lot of food but as the nice lady serving us said we can have the leftovers for breakfast.
The breadsticks were totes amaze and is definitely worth getting if you head this way. The pizzas were brilliant, cooked to perfection, I ordered the carnivore pizza which came with black pudding so I was a very full boy pretty soon. The girlfriend ordered the Emilia and wouldn‚Äôt let me try her pizza which means it must have been good. Quite a small establishment but the guys there made us feel very welcome and insisted we move to a bigger table to feel more comfortable"
"Oak Fire Pizza - Princes Street",209,"Allie Morris",153,"a week ago",5,"Great pizza!! Thought the sides were only okay but the actual pizza was really delicious and just what we wanted. Not sure what the previous reviews meant about the pizza being soggy or floppy unless they doused it with oil."
"Oak Fire Pizza - Princes Street",209,"brettroberts987",364,"a month ago",5,"Stopped here for lunch and had 2 pizzas. One was the new York and the other was the pepperoni. Great pizza with good sauce, toppings and the crust was great. Wood fired over have good flavour and right amount of char. Service was quick and friendly"
"Oak Fire Pizza - Princes Street",209,"Robert Schuppert-McDonald",2149,"a year ago",4,"The pizza was made with quality sauce, mozzarella cheese, a slightly spicy pepperoni, and thinly sliced mushrooms. It was the best tasting pizza I have had in recent dining out (which has been often since moving to Ireland). The inside seating is on the smaller size, but there is ample outside seating available. It's only gave 4-stars since the middle of the crust was too wet making the slices have soggy tips. If the pie had 20 more seconds in the fiercely hot stone oven it might have been perfect. Overall a good pizza and we will return when at City Center in Cork, Ireland."
"Oak Fire Pizza - Princes Street",209,"Will Quane",2605,"a month ago",1,"Went for a  GF BBQ chicken pizza and an utter disappointment, toppings were minimal and in the centre of the pizza, the base was just horrible dry and frankly difficult to chew, Cheap and Nasty is all I can say"
"Oak Fire Pizza - Princes Street",209,"Renata Tutalak",2109,"5 months ago",3,"Tempted by good reviews, she came to the pizzeria on her son's birthday. I was expecting a delicious pizza, but I was disappointed. The pizza was terribly wet and it was impossible to hold it in your hand. The ingredients were flowing And I ate this unfortunate pizza with the help of a fork. I had tomato soup on my plate."
"Oak Fire Pizza - Princes Street",209,"Todd Hunt",2506,"3 months ago",4,"Had take away, and it was not bad. The crust was good yet the tomato sauce was not great, basic like a jar of ragu. My wife‚Äôs  pizza crust was burnt all the way around. Good for a late drunken night  pizza."
"Oak Fire Pizza - Princes Street",209,"Cam Krueger",412,"2 months ago",3,"Tried the Carnivore. The crust lacked that satisfying snap‚Äîcrispy on the edge but soggy in the middle, possibly from an overheated oven. The sauce played it too safe, missing any real punch. Toppings were heavy-handed, with too much cheese overwhelming the rest. Overall, it felt more like a missed opportunity than a bold bite."
"Oak Fire Pizza - Princes Street",209,"Patty Gianfelice",2002,"2 years ago",4,"A very good Pizza but not ""The Best"" as it was hyped to be.  The dough, while tasty, was limp... I prefer a crisp crusty dough that holds up under the sauce and toppings. The sauce was pretty good, tomatoey, sweet and not overdone.  The Cheese was tasty.  My son loved his Pepperoni Pizza. A good pizza but I've had much better. The service wasn't very friendly either. You would expect that they would provide a flimsy paper plate on takeout orders considering that the city accommodates many hotel guests, but not here!. We were lucky to grab a few napkins."
"Oak Fire Pizza - Princes Street",209,"Bogdan Ogonowski",353,"5 months ago",3,"I was excited to try this pizzeria because it looks nice inside, but unfortunately, the pizza was quite disappointing. The slices were very loose and kept falling apart, which made it difficult to eat. The crust was too thin and there were too many toppings, making the pizza feel messy rather than tasty. Additionally, the pizza was quite spicy, but there was no information about this on the menu, which caught me off guard. Overall, the appearance was appealing, but the taste and texture didn‚Äôt meet my expectations."
"Sultan Cafe Restaurant & Shisha Lounge",210,"Ana Gon√ßalves",182,"7 months ago",5,"I want to say it was a perfect experience, the food was some of the best I ate in Cork, I even say in Ireland.

Thanks so much for this moment"
"The Garden Cafe",1,"F Whizzer",858,"9 months ago",5,"Been here twice. Lovely Victorian greenhouse set up as cafe. Very good value for money. Greenery around you and fab view of northside.Had a soup and sandwich. Very nice and decent amount. Sandwich wasn't your skinny stuff you get in lots of places. Proper sandwich.
Not much parking at all. Better on foot if possible. But worth it.
They even give you blankets in winter. It is a greenhouse but heaters also. Definitely return."

"Sultan Cafe Restaurant & Shisha Lounge",210,"Aaron M",24,"a year ago",4,"Decent overall experience.  Some menu options were not available, and our waitress recommended bottled water with an unfortunate explanation as to why we needed bottled water.

"Sultan Cafe Restaurant & Shisha Lounge",210,"Imtiaz Sheikh",1078,"4 months ago",1,"I am from ‚Äúout of town‚Äù. Went for a meal with my family. We were asked to wait whilst the restaurant was virtually empty! However whilst we were not familiar with the Moroccan meal, the waiter made no suggestion or recommendation when asked about menu and wait kind of meal one could expect. After taking a chance with the non descriptive menu we ordered what read exotic. After having hardly finished our meal the plates were cleared off the table. No questions asked or any exchange of decency, we asked if we wanted to pay cash or pay by card.I told the waiter could we two minutes please. That we were given and within two minutes the same waiter came out from behind the curtains and said ‚Äú have you finished and will you pay by cash or credit.‚Äù My family were taken surprised by waiters attitude throughout the evening. We really got the message  and paid the bill of 78 euro for not so good meal and left. Not worth a visit if we ask me."
"Sultan Cafe Restaurant & Shisha Lounge",210,"Dan Stones",605,"a year ago",5,"I had an amazing spice box from the pop up stall in Marina Market. The service was great and the very nice to chat with.

The atmosphere in The food market is amazing and everyone is very welcoming"

"Butlers Chocolate Caf√©",211,"Paul Hennessy",2013,"4 years ago",4,"Good coffee but expected great coffee. Chocolates are really nice and a great touch to get one free with a drink.

Would like to see more from this store around coffee - perhaps single origins and a focus on something special."
"Butlers Chocolate Caf√©",211,"Travel",2535,"a month ago",1,"I‚Äôm a big fan of hot dark chocolate, so I was excited to try it at Butlers a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, it was so poorly made that I couldn‚Äôt finish it. Hoping it was just a one-off mistake, I gave them another chance today, but again, it was even worse, with a burnt taste. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening to this famous cafe, but the quality feels completely ruined. Very disappointing, and I‚Äôve decided not to return. Definitely not worth it anymore."
"Butlers Chocolate Caf√©",211,"Srikhar Chandu",2372,"a month ago",1,"I‚Äôve always enjoyed dark hot chocolate, but not anymore at Butlers. Twice I tried within a few weeks, because I couldn‚Äôt let myself stop drinking something I usually love, but both times were awful. The second time was even worse, with a full burnt taste. I truly hope they improve the quality, because it‚Äôs very disappointing for such a well-known cafe."

Service: service was friendly and quite fast.

Ambience: beautiful and cozy ambience. They have a cute fishtank at the entrance which we loved. Every table has a small lamp which gives very cozy vibes.

Definitely coming here for more"
"Gallo & Galetti",212,"Anatoliy",190,"5 months ago",5,"So, so, good.

"Gallo & Galetti",212,"Thorsten Steinbach",2488,"10 months ago",5,"After 11 years in Ireland and testing restaurants,diner and other food location's, I have to say ,this restaurant is a benchmark in Italian food. Fresh modern and clean location. Outstanding menus and kitchen. A flavourful taste explosion from the starter to the desserts. Family friendly and a lot of space. If you look for authentic Italian food,this restaurant should be on the top of your list."
"Gallo & Galetti",212,"Gill Bann",963,"2 months ago",5,"We turned up here and got the last table for two.
In hindsight we should have booked - a large youth group turned up soon after us, we just got lucky.
The menu has a good selection, the food was tasty and very nicely cooked.
Irish style cheesecake is a new one for me, it was different to what I'm used to but still delicious.
The only disappointment was no loo roll in the ladies. Unfortunate, but one star off for that."
"Gallo & Galetti",212,"kieran Kenneally",1438,"4 months ago",2,"This is an unusual one for me because it's the first time it ever happened.
We were here on Mother's Day for my wife and we had a beautiful meal on our first visit here except for one thing. My wife, the mother in Mother's Day, got food poisoning. Now it not like a, are you sure it was our food moment. She vomited her guts up an hour after the meal, the doctor said it was food poisoning, she had to take time off work, we reported it to the food authority and most importantly, it has never happened to her before.
The worst thing about it is that everyone else except my wife had a lovely meal and the food was excellent.
Why am I writing this now, weeks later? It happened, that's why. I'm not one of these people who complain on the day and try get something back, it's just not something I do. When I go somewhere and the meal or service or anything else is bad, I just never go back. But here, like I said, for everyone else, the food and experience was good but it affected my wife so bad she actually said in the days afterwards that ""she would never eat seafood out again!"" By the way, it was the seafood casserole on the ""Specials"" menu. The old saying about never eat off the specials menu because it's just stuff they are trying to get rid of rings true. We were aware of this but...
Anyway, it's hard to give a good review because of the circumstances and it wasn‚Äôt very cheap either so that's just the reality.
My daughter has been back since for pizza and the pizza is delicious but none of the rest of us have returned."
"Gallo & Galetti",212,"Cheeky Gorls",456,"5 days ago",2,"Not a good experience. Staff quite unfriendly (except for one guy from cork with shaved head), very slow service. It took ages to get someone to take our order and no attention to service eg no refilling of water.

Extremely poor acoustics. Very loud and can hear everyone else‚Äôs conversations.

Food just OK. Spaghetti bolognese very sweet.

Would not recommend and don‚Äôt understand the other food reviews"

"Lab 82 Coffee",213,"Diane‚Äôs Travel",722,"2 months ago",4,"Nice place,opposite train station in cork.Stuff was ok, place is quiet busy,waiter was hangover for sure lol.
About the food I have mix feelings,the place was recommended by a friend. First of all minimum details missing from the table like salt and pepper and napkins‚Ä¶I was surprised to be honest‚Ä¶and intrigued on the same time,because this place is high spoken.
Eggs were fine cooked,soft as it should be,but no tasty.food on the place was plain ,although looked alright,but,no seasoning and,the hollandaise was not at the greatest quality either.
22,50 for eggs florentine and chips‚Ä¶ quiet expensive,in my opinion . 26,50 with dessert and no coffee .
Will I be back?Maybe,to try their coffee because I didn‚Äôt this time and I love coffee.

Thanks guys you are doing great jobs but maybe more attention to details will make the difference."

Service aside, the food (especially the milkshakes) was good.

We went in Saturday afternoon to watch a hurling match. Our round of non-alcoholic drinks was served with an unaccountable bad grace, then moving his chairs a little so we could see the screen induced a foul-mouthed tirade.

"Goldie",217,"Christine Alexander",487,"4 months ago",5,"Goldie came highly recommended on social media and online and we were absolutely delighted to say it lives up to the hype. Everything was delicious and the chef has a masterful touch with flavors and textures and honors the local ingredients beautifully. Our server was helpful with recommendations and happy to answer any of our questions. Make sure to get a reservation as we noticed many people try to walk in and they had to be turned away. Prices were reasonable‚Äîparticularly considering the quality of the ingredients and beautiful presentation. Everything was delicious (including the dessert) and this was the best food we‚Äôve be had in Ireland so far.  We also love the commitment of the chef to sustainability and minimizing food waste. 11/10 would recommend to anyone visiting cork who is looking for an excellent meal!"
"Goldie",217,"Tim C",2492,"a month ago",5,"Absolutely outstanding üëè
One of the best meals of my life. This had been on my list to book for ages. Very warm welcome on arrival. Always great to see an open kitchen and watch chefs work in front of you.
The food was stellar. Every dish perfect. I felt the prices were very good. The restaurant is priced similar to most bistros or restaurants in the city but is offering a quality that is on par with any high end restaurant in the country.
Don't pass up the opportunity to book here. You will not be disappointed"
"Goldie",217,"Wen Qi Seow",2601,"4 months ago",5,"The food here is absolutely amazing. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was superb too. Although I enjoyed every single dish, I particularly loved the cod fish!

Service was also excellent, the staff were friendly and also put in the effort to explain almost every dish on the menu. Appreciate it!

I would highly recommend this place if you are in Cork!"
"Goldie",217,"Daniel Atkinson",612,"2 months ago",5,"Amazing food, amazing service. Just great.

"Goldie",217,"yosbely hernandez",2637,"5 months ago",5,"The food was spectacular, with an impeccable presentation. The small plates were bursting with flavors, colors, and textures, truly fascinating. Moreover, the service was exceptional, as they explained each dish in detail."
"Goldie",217,"W K",2593,"7 months ago",5,"Amazing food and great atmosphere. Luckily sat on the counter table overlooking the kitchen getting a great view into how it‚Äôs all made.

Seasonal ingredients and super fresh fish - portion sizes were on the larger side for a restaurant like this!"
"Goldie",217,"Aoife Costello",257,"7 months ago",5,"Goldie is hands down one of the best dining experiences I‚Äôve had in Cork! From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the staff made us feel so welcome. The seafood was unbelievably fresh, and you can really taste the care that goes into every dish. Everything about this place is just fantastic. Can‚Äôt wait to come back! 5 stars all the way!"
"Goldie",217,"Isabelle Logan",1094,"7 months ago",5,"One of our favourite meals we‚Äôve ever had!!

"Sonny's Deli",218,"Brendan Brendan",359,"Edited 3 months ago",4,"Bagel was very good, however the cost of nearly 10 euro was a bit on the high side. The quality of the bagel was excellent however"
"Sonny's Deli",218,"Laura Leahy",1470,"3 years ago",5,"Outstanding - went here today, pre-ordered for click and collect - got the smoked chicken and peppers sandwich, a sausage roll and 2 mini donuts filled with custard.

"Sonny's Deli",218,"grace mcl",987,"2 years ago",5,"We get lunch from regularly, it‚Äôs always fresh as never disappointing.
It‚Äôs best if you pre order or go early because if sells out quickly. The staff are very good at updating the options.

The change up the soups which is nice.
Good salad selection and options
The sweet treats the have one offer are very good, the brownies or carrot cake are favourites.

The chicken bagel or the Vietnamese pork roll would be my strong recommendations.
Also the sausage rolls in the morning are one of the best around"

"Cask",219,"Paul Reid",2017,"2 months ago",5,"Great cocktails, by mixologists that know their stuff and who are happy to field questions. Was there at opening time on a Sunday, so didn't have to book, but seemed like there were a lot of bookings from 5pm. Small plates of food are outstanding - particularly the trout tostada. This place has it all. A must visit if you are into cocktails."
"Cask",219,"Jemima Daisy",1187,"3 weeks ago",5,"Great food, lovely staff, gorgeous drinks. Reccomend the beef cheek and the nine lives cocktail.
We sat outside under a heater with our dog who was also treated like a guest!"
"Cask",219,"Jack Coughlan",1119,"5 months ago",5,"Stopped by Cask while in Cork and had a great experience. We ordered a Moretti and a cocktail‚Äîboth well served and enjoyable. The bartender was friendly, knowledgeable, and took time to explain a few of the cocktail options, which added a nice personal touch to the visit. The venue itself is stylish and classy without feeling pretentious‚Äîperfect for a relaxed drink in a refined setting. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for quality drinks and great service in a polished atmosphere."
"Cask",219,"Ana Maria Merlin",183,"6 months ago",4,"Great experience! The atmosphere at the bar is super pleasant, cozy, and perfect for a good time with friends. The staff was very polite and attentive, which made all the difference. The food was really good, but I missed having more vegetarian options on the menu. It would be great to see more variety in that regard. Overall, a very positive experience, and I‚Äôll definitely be back!"
"Cask",219,"Brian Hudson",374,"3 months ago",5,"Fabulous food, great cocktails menu - they make to die for Irish Mule. Drink prices are on the high side but we had a sharing board of charcuterie and cheeses that was very good value."
"Cask",219,"Luke Ratterman",1580,"Edited 2 months ago",5,"Everything about Cask was absolutely lovely besides the beef dish that had very little meat and was mostly fat and gristle which is why I couldn't give it the full 5 stars. The ambiance is a 5 star so it's a great place to take a date. The tapas are high quality but I have had better for lower prices locally. Edit... it now has 5 stars all the way with the new dishes!!!"
"Cask",219,"Tabitha Sandberg",2437,"a year ago",5,"This place is fantastic. The staff is incredibly friendly, the drinks are the best, and the food is amazing. My favorite thing was the pesto that came with the bread, butter and hummus. Absolutely the best pesto I've ever had. The ribs are fall apart tender and full of flavor."
"Hysterical Histories Cork",220,"Susan Brock",2419,"a month ago",5,"The best experience ever! I was in Ireland for my first time as part of a hen weekend. I enjoyed this so much as it was hilarious but I also learnt so much about Cork. The three actresses were so talented and had beautiful singing voices. Thank you for a magical evening with delicious food"
"Hysterical Histories Cork",220,"Se√°n O'Math√∫na",2294,"a month ago",5,"I went on the Cork on a Fork walking tour and attended the dinner at Amicus on Friday. I would highly recommend both experiences.

Angela was a fantastic host who answered every question well and provided a huge amount of local insight and fun for all ages.

The dinner was top notch and the show itself breezy and very funny with renditions of famous Cork songs and stories."
"Hysterical Histories Cork",220,"James Dwane",1143,"3 weeks ago",5,"We had a great time! The performers and staff were very friendly, warm and welcoming.  They made us feel at home right away and, before we knew it we were making friends with the other members of the audience.  The food was better than we expected, considering that it was a dinner theater environment. The show itself was based on the history of Cork and was educational, informative and funny. The whole experience was much better than we had expected."
"Hysterical Histories Cork",220,"Kayla Diaz de Arce",1391,"a month ago",5,"One of the best highlights of our time in Ireland (and our favorite in Cork!) They're put on a wonderful show and the food was delicious! This is a must-do if you're in Cork!"
"Hysterical Histories Cork",220,"Charles Morgan",455,"a month ago",1,"Poor Organization & Rushed Service
I was really looking forward to Hysterical Histories Cork, but the whole evening felt disorganized. The dinner service was rushed, and the food came out lukewarm. It felt like the staff was just trying to push everyone through quickly rather than creating a welcoming atmosphere. The performers themselves were energetic, but the constant interruptions during the meal made it hard to enjoy either the food or the show. For the price, I expected something smoother and more professional. The storyline was a bit chaotic, and while some jokes landed, others felt tired and repetitive. It wasn‚Äôt the kind of engaging historical experience I was promised. Instead, it felt like a tourist trap trying too hard to be funny. Overall, between the poor service, average food, and messy pacing, I left feeling underwhelmed. Definitely not worth the time or money compared to other entertainment options in Cork."
"Hysterical Histories Cork",220,"Anne O'Sullivan",236,"a month ago",5,"I must say we really enjoyed night and didn‚Äôt expect it to be so entertaining. We live in Cork but still thoroughly enjoyed learning more about the City in a comical way. The three actors were brilliant. They put so much effort into it. I would really strongly recommend it even for tourists to learn about Cork in an entertaining way."

"The Garden Cafe",1,"Patricia Crean",1990,"Edited 2 years ago",5,"Love this lol cafe isolated out of sight off Blackpool, gorgeous spot for lunch when the sun is shining. But I enjoy the cafe in all weathers, defo worth checking out. Great gardens of all sorts flowers, fruits, veg & herbs. A beautiful variety and staff are very pleasant"
"Hysterical Histories Cork",220,"Sue ORourke",2415,"2 months ago",5,"A very adorable show.  You learn a lot about the history of Cork with a crew of delightfully cute and funny ladies who we enjoyed chit chatting with during the intermissions.  It's a very personal and intimate experience.  The food is delicious!!   I would recommend!"
"Hysterical Histories Cork",220,"Lina akli",1518,"a year ago",5,"What an amazing experience! The performers were engaging, kind, and entertaining throughout.

"Mr Bradley's",221,"Evan o'Sullivan",855,"3 months ago",5,"Easily one of the best pubs in Cork at the moment. The staff are sound, the pints are always spot on (especially the stout), and the beer garden is a proper gem ‚Äî clean, spacious, and great vibes all round.

"The Lough Caf√©",223,"Krist√≠na N.",1451,"5 months ago",4,"Good coffee and cakes. The interior is very nice and cozy and they even have outdoor seating which is great when the weather is nice. A big downside, however, is the lack of wifi and really bad reception in the area which makes it almost impossible to use a hotspot. :/"
"Mr Bradley's",221,"tomas allen",2518,"a year ago",5,"Doesn't do food but can eat fabulous pizzas from next door on the premises. Friendly staff. Fantastic pints of Beamish. Like a country pub but in the city. Definitely worth calling into if you're sick of the big pub c**p. Loved the place. The only negative was that the place was a bit cold but that's more me than them"

"Mr Bradley's",221,"Onur Toptas",1951,"2 years ago",5,"Friendly staff, great stout and rather quiet atmosphere. No TV and music is not too loud so it‚Äôs ideal for chat & read. Not a traditional all wooden Irish pub but spacious and humble interior. Loved their playlists also; from joy division to radiohead & 80‚Äôs 90‚Äôs rock."
"The Old Town Whiskey Bar at Bodega",222,"Jason Anthony Biggs",1169,"a month ago",4,"I been here 4 times on different occasions a date a nightout now today food.

Please book table if you are getting food."
"The Old Town Whiskey Bar at Bodega",222,"Michael Grabovskyi",1752,"2 months ago",5,"Beer was great, no complaints there. The atmosphere was solid, just what you‚Äôd expect from an Irish pub in Ireland.

There‚Äôs an impressive variety of whiskey, so don‚Äôt miss the chance to try some less common ones.

Overall, not the cheapest place, but worth it for the experience."
"The Old Town Whiskey Bar at Bodega",222,"A J (Lexi)",14,"a month ago",5,"Pretty place! Beamish!! We were there early 1:20pm and it was nice and peaceful."
"The Old Town Whiskey Bar at Bodega",222,"Grant Oakes",993,"7 months ago",4,"Only reason this gets a 4 star if the burger we had that's it. This place is a massive surprise, outside you wouldn't think it was this cool and nice.

I would recommend 100%."
"The Old Town Whiskey Bar at Bodega",222,"Sara Byrne Byrne",2243,"3 months ago",2,"Visually charming and the wine list is fine, but the experience felt strangely empty.
Like being served a story that everyone‚Äôs pretending to believe.
If you enjoy theatrics more than connection, this might be your place."
"Good for the Soul",340,"BRINIS Ghassen",388,"2 weeks ago",1,"We thought we had found our new favorite spot. The coffee was amazing, the atmosphere was warm, and we were genuinely made to feel welcome. We were even guided to a table we loved.

That's why it was so jarring when, just 15 minutes after sitting down,with our drinks in hand for only 10,the manager informed us that our table is booked in 10 minutesüòÖ. In Ireland, it's well understood that ordering grants you the right to your seat to enjoy your purchase. They knew this, yet they chose to ask us to leave indirectly.

We absolutely loved the place, but we won't be returning. The feeling of disrespect is just too strong.

A simple request: just be transparent. If a table has a time limit, tell us before we order and fall in love with the experience. Don't let customers get comfortable only to usher them out the door.

Honesty benefits everyone."
"MYXTIQ Cork City",31,"Tanya Dobbyn",2444,"a month ago",3,"Disappointed 2 of the starters I ordered were unavailable. The lentil donuts were pure oily and tasted burnt. Veg curry was basic. It lacks variety, just peas and diced carrots. Was excited to try this place but it wasn't great."
"The Old Town Whiskey Bar at Bodega",222,"Fiona Pawley",881,"a month ago",1,"This place is weird and a bit grim. Service was odd, I wanted a vodka and soda, I was told they only served Smirnoff vodka when there were 2 other options on the shelf. My partner ordered a whisky, we came here due to the name and the wide range of whiskies. The bar tender had to go and wash a whisky glass, it wasn‚Äôt busy, not sure why they were out of whisky glasses. Presenting the plain tumbler (based on the announcement from the bar tender about getting a glass I was expecting some special whiskey glass) wet, He wiped it with a dirty tea towel and poured the drink.

The place is huge but laid out for dining, there was no where to sit with just drinks so we went outside to the tables on the street. It is all pretty grim and sticky. The awnings whilst providing shelter were disgusting, there were flies everywhere too. The furniture is dirty and uncomfortable.
The toilets were also dark and grim.

All in all this place has great potential, with a wide range of whiskeys and a historical large building, they would benefit from giving the place a clean to start with. Then perhaps stock up on some appropriate glassware for serving whisky.

Wouldn‚Äôt recommend"
"The Old Town Whiskey Bar at Bodega",222,"Koby",1446,"11 months ago",3,"I went to this place after looking at the reviews  and pictures online . I was very excited to try a nice traditional Irish stew as the pictures looked great. Unfortunately the Irish stew was one of the worst I have tried in Ireland. It was extremely watery and seemed more like a broth than a stew. The potatoes were hard and the meat was tough. The place and the staff were really nice but the food wasn't up to scratch."
"The Old Town Whiskey Bar at Bodega",222,"Antonio Stamerra",252,"3 months ago",5,"We're in Cork for a conference at UCC and were searching for a spot that offered both dinner and a great whiskey selection. This place seemed like the perfect fit, and it certainly exceeded our expectations! The food was enjoyable, and they boasted an excellent array of beers and whiskeys. It's definitely worth a return visit. The bartender was particularly nice, attentive, and kind.
Just disappointed to not have had the opportunity to try the stew, which they used to have in the menu earlier.
Great background music."
"The Old Town Whiskey Bar at Bodega",222,"Jeremy Vogel",1201,"Edited 6 months ago",5,"This pub is a *must* visit if you are in the area! Lots of seating, awesome whiskey and beer selections (obviously), and a fantastic vibe overall. You won't regret the stop...I guarantee it."

"The Lough Caf√©",223,"J Cronin",1108,"5 months ago",5,"I really enjoyed my visits here. It has a kinda rustic vibe but it's comfortable and peaceful when it's not very busy. The character and ambience is unique and charming with books and different kind of art on the walls. The cappuccino was absolutely perfect, one of the best I've had anywhere and they have some nice cakes too.
The seating inside is cosy if it isn't too busy as there's limited seating if the demand is higher. There's outside seating too if that's your thing. I saw complaints about phone coverage, but I didn't have that problem.
Overall, it's a very nice coffee shop."

Enjoyed a lovely Americano with cream. Just what I needed. Such great people work there too.
Well behaved dogs are allowed which is very welcoming being so close to the Lough üê∂.
Great space outdoors as well as in. Eclectic design which I love. Please try this place. You won't be disappointed?"
"The Lough Caf√©",223,"Liz Considine",1532,"2 months ago",3,"Pretty place. Nice enough food. Staff are overwhelmed by one person at the counter. They also don't greet and make one feel welcome. Customer service training required.

Enjoyed the visit together with a walk around the lake!"
"The Lough Caf√©",223,"Kevin McCabe",1426,"3 years ago",5,"Popped in for a quick coffee mid day. Loved the vibe, friendly people, lots of patrons filling the place with afternoon discussion. I can understand why, this was a delicious cup of coffee. They have some pastries as well as a few flavors of ice cream. The building is quite small and tight (cozy). There is some fairly close quarters seating inside, as well as a pretty large (for Irish coffee shop standards) outdoor seating are as well. Highly recommend if checking out the lough and seeking a coffee break."

"The Farmgate Cafe",224,"Anthony Gerrard",243,"2 months ago",5,"A delightful moment spent in one of Cork's iconic places: The English Market. The cuisine is delicious and carefully prepared, served by a staff of exemplary courtesy, attentive, responsive, and professional. I recommend the chicken supreme with lemon and fennel, and for dessert, the famous bread & butter pudding or Chocolat√© Brownie. A place you can go without the slightest hesitation."
"The Farmgate Cafe",224,"mandy kerr",1605,"2 months ago",4,"Cafe above The English Market.

"The Farmgate Cafe",224,"Karel Beyen",1345,"2 months ago",5,"Cool place to eat at the English market, the dishes vibe middle segment restauranty, were tasty, and made with local ingredients.

"The Farmgate Cafe",224,"Jake Higgins",1136,"6 months ago",4,"All the produce is fresh & local and you can really taste this. However, you are paying for the privilege of this & the setting it is in. A nice experience but not in a rush to go back."
"The Farmgate Cafe",224,"Marc Remis",1609,"11 months ago",4,"Everyone liked their food, limited menu, popular so lines of people felt crowded to me. No staff pushing us to leave after eating, clean restrooms. I had mushroom soup loaded with those vegetables, The bowl was a large portion, bead and Irish butter very good, you could smell the fresh meats from the famous British Market on the street level below. Prices seemed reasonable. We would come again if the opportunity arose."
"The Farmgate Cafe",224,"Benny Iskandar",333,"6 months ago",5,"Our family really enjoyed the lunch. The service was extremely good with the friendly staff. We recommended salt cod and potato croquette, fish chowder and fish of the day - Cod fish."
"The Farmgate Cafe",224,"Harini Reviews",1019,"a year ago",5,"The food was amazing. We came here for breakfast. Got the Market English Breakfast and Field Mushrooms & Roast Tomatoes | Parmesan | Sourdough Toast, orange juice and ice latte with oat milk.

The Market English was really good. Scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked and the Coughlan's Sausages were really tasty. Would be really nice if there were beans in there too (maybe instead of the black pudding). The portion size was really big.

The Field Mushrooms & Roast Tomatoes | Parmesan | Sourdough Toast was lovely. A good portion.

Ice latte was good (no sweeteners available) but orange juice was a really small portion.

Really nice caf√® and highly recommend!

Service was 10/10. Had to wait about 5minutes to dine in."

A very cozy atmosphere with warm lights , fireplace and lots of plants and cushions makes you want to relax and sip cocktails for the rest of your Sunday .

We started by ordering the crispy sushi rice and they were incredibly tasty with just the right amount of spice to it.

After that, we noticed we were still hungry, so we ordered two other dishes to nibble at while drinking: the Garlic & Chilli Atlantic Prawns and the Shredded Chicken.

The Atlantic Prawns were very good, but a bit expensive for its size (‚Ç¨16). But the Shredded Chicken was the highlight of the evening. Incredibly tasty and its price was very good for its portion size.

The staff serving us were very efficient and super friendly during the whole evening and I wish I knew their names because they deserve the compliments and recognition."

This happened at least 3 times over the space of 45mins. After about 30 we tried waving to catch her attention. Moved up to the bar to try and get served and was ignored by the staff again.

We were perfectly sober, weren't rude in the slightest and were drinking relatively expensive whiskey. They also advertise themselves as a whiskey bar and seemed very surprised that we ordered whiskey. Have no idea why we were ignored but will never be back"

"The Pav",228,"kieran Kenneally",1438,"a year ago",3,"First time in here, popped in as I was passing and just wanted a look.
Bar itself looks great, very square, like drinking in a big dark box. Decor is beautiful, bar counter and behind very nice. Glasses arranged behind bar looked beautiful, staff very friendly and efficient.
So, where does it lose its stars.
The bar itself strikes me as a place you only go when going to the main venue upstairs which is some kind of club/disco/concert venue.
There is no toilet on the ground floor which is a pain and very little natural light or air in the room. The air in here just kind of hangs there doing nothing. Have they air conditioning? Who knows.
From that point of view it just wouldn't be my cup of tea.
Other negative, got charged ‚Ç¨6 for a bottle of Bud! First drink in three months, wouldn't encourage me to have a session at those prices, especially when I could get it on draft in another pub less than 200 metres away for virtually the same price.
Would like to go to something in the club sometime just for a look but other than that I just prefer more light and air in a bar."

Our total came out to almost $40 USD! That‚Äôs more than NYC prices! It was a pretty big portion, but I don‚Äôt think it was $40 worth. Plus, the meats were kind of dry.

I didn‚Äôt know what I was gonna order so I decided to ask for recommendations. I told them I could wait until the line was empty , but the staff there were super nice and extremely helpful, giving me their best recommendation even though they were pretty busy.

I went with what they recommended, which was a mix kebab platter (half chicken, half lamb). It also came with garlic sauce, some spicy one (which was very good), salad and some bread underneath it. The meal option also comes with rice/fries. You can also ask it to be a 50/50 mix.

The food was tasty, well-made and pretty good, but I thought that spending almost ‚Ç¨17 on this dish (it included a drink) was a bit overpriced for what it is.

The atmosphere was grand. Not much to say, honestly. The design isn‚Äôt the best, but it isn‚Äôy dirty or anything like that. Just not that visually appealing.

"Homer Bar",232,"Gav Bain",926,"4 months ago",5,"Watching the champions league final here, great staff, great regulars, great prices. The best bar I've been to in cork. 5* is not enough praise, thoroughly enjoyed my time here. üçÄ"
"Homer Bar",232,"Arthur Cole",276,"2 years ago",5,"100% local joint, fantastic people and great conversation.  Beer and cider were cold, what more could we ask for while in Ireland! Would recommend stopping in if you are in Cork and wandering the Shandon Mile"
"Starbucks Princes Street",13,"Abi Makovsky",31,"6 years ago",5,"Lovely and friendly staff. Coffee is always good and specialty drinks are always made exactly to par.

"Homer Bar",232,"George Kyritsis",945,"2 years ago",5,"THE HOMER BAR, Cork

Chanced upon this lovely place!  A real Irish Bar with a warm atmosphere bustling with banter between the locals!  I was initially attracted by the name Homer thinking it has to do with the classical historian.  Being Greek that tweaked my curiosity so I walked in to the sound of Abba playing on the tele.  I then realized the name has more to do with a type of pigeon which like the customers here, always return!  It is a grand place, charming and with a character all its own!  If you‚Äôre lucky enough to be there during the day, you‚Äôll have the privilege of meeting Esther the bar lady who is one of the most welcoming lady you can meet.  Even though you‚Äôre a passer by, she‚Äôll make you feel at home! Exactly what you would expect from a real Irish Pub - warmth, laughter and Irish hospitality!  I highly recommend it !  The people, as everywhere in Ireland are warm and jovial and welcoming!  You are also very close to the Clock of Four Faces which is also referred to as the The Four Liars because of the fact that each face has a clock which has a mind of its own!  They‚Äôre close but never in sync !  I would say the closest you could get to time travel while enjoying a pint of your favourite brew!"
"Homer Bar",232,"Stephen O Regan",2398,"9 months ago",3,"1st time at the Homer Bar Shandon Street Cork. Nice small Irish bar! Old fashioned Irish style bar! Older Customers here!

"Iberian Way",233,"Alison S",150,"a week ago",5,"Recently enjoyed a lovely meal here. We had 5 small plates between 2 of us which was plenty. Wine was delicious. Service was great and our server recommended the ‚Äòtorrija‚Äô for dessert which was the highlight of the meal for me!
Yes plates seem a little bit expensive for tapas but overall our bill was not more expensive than other restaurants in Cork these days and we were fully satisfied.
We will definitely be back üòä"
"Iberian Way",233,"Roc√≠o Esperanza Segovia Calder√≥n",2156,"a month ago",5,"Food was delicious! Genuinely Spanish food, and the most kind staff. The atmosphere was perfect for a date with my husband.
warm and cozy, almost like a short trip to Spain. We‚Äôre definitely going back!"
"Iberian Way",233,"John Fitzgerald",1255,"2 months ago",3,"Used to come here a lot but now has become really really expensive. Most dishes were delicious, the chicken thighs and broken eggs used to be better. The red wine was nice, the white was only okay. Lola's in Dublin only charge on average ‚Ç¨9 - ‚Ç¨10 per plate guys. Will be back but less often now due to prices. Staff were also very pleasant."
"Iberian Way",233,"clare healy",530,"4 weeks ago",5,"A true touch taste of Spain in Cork. The relaxed atmosphere coupled with the friendly and attentive staff (especially Blanca) always make this an enjoyable experience. It's a great place to gather with friends to share the  flavorful tapas. Highly recommend the auburgines with honey, the croquettas and the tortilla but everything is really tasty! The wine selections available make a great pairing with the tapas."

"Iberian Way",233,"Virginia Chiodi",2584,"a month ago",2,"Since the reviews were excellent, we came here for dinner (3 people). Judging from the prices (12/15‚Ç¨ each) we mistakenly thought that one portion was enough for one person, but when we saw the quantity (too small even for a kid) we were baffled and we couldn't understand whether the 15‚Ç¨ price included all the 3 tiny dishes or only a single one. To eat a proper dinner we should've ordered at least other 2 dishes for each of us and spend at least other 50‚Ç¨.
In total we spent 60‚Ç¨ for a portion of patatas bravas (quite expensive, but fair) and 3 tiny portions of chorizo + 2 cokes because the water tasted awful."
"Iberian Way",233,"S ODriscoll",2209,"3 weeks ago",1,"Very Disappointing, wont be back.  Service was awful,  a long wait between dishes and considering they are clear you only have an hour and a half its a bit mean of them.  We were at no point asked if anything was okay.  Our wine was poured for us with no opportunity to taste... Food was ok if you wanted a lot of chips (baby potatoes deep fried) Bravos were Chips as before with a light gravy.. virtually no pork in the pork special  just chips and the chicken skewers were tasty but dry, we also has the chorizo which was nice but tiny.  Wine was nice but expensive.  Oh and the chair I was given was broken and when I asked for a replacement there was no surprise.  They did credit us one dish for the wait but they had already spoiled our meal. What a waste of an evening."
"Iberian Way",233,"Gwyn Harris",1001,"a week ago",5,"Wonderful tapas restaurant. Clearly well sourced Spanish ingredients served with great care and attention. Particular shout out to the amazing tortilla."
"Iberian Way",233,"Amayo C√¥te",167,"a month ago",4,"Nice atmosphere with music playing and friendly staff.

The food arrived very fast to our surprise and was quite good, albeit slightly undercooked for the squid, as about half the rings weren't crusty but rather squishy.
The chicken skewers with moroccan spices were delicious...but 2 skewers on bread with a small yoghurt sauce cannot be ‚Ç¨15. Some dishes were very small for their price, which seems to be a recurring issue apparently.
I personally enjoyed the smoky tasting bravas with their sauce.

We spent around ‚Ç¨70 for two adults without any drinks."
"Iberian Way",233,"Lucia O'Donovan",1562,"3 months ago",5,"Very enjoyable meal and lovely wine."
"Iberian Way",233,"Helen L",1037,"4 months ago",3,"First time visiting last night. Service was good and quite fast but portions are small and very basic for the price. Overall, I felt the food lacked vibrancy in comparison to other tapas bars in town."
"Caf√© Velo",5,"Fallon Hasana",862,"a month ago",5,"We had a group of 4 and everyone LOVED what they ordered yesterday. I had the Smashed Avocado and I‚Äôd order it over and over again.

"Bombay Palace",234,"Eamon Bundred",756,"a month ago",5,"Wow. What a hidden gem. The food was excellent. I eat in a lot of Indian restaurants and they are usually ok, but the food here knocks them out of the water. The way it tasted was exquisite , leaving a nice aftertaste. The family who run the restaurant are very proud of what they provide and it shows. A superb place to eat. Highly recommend."
"Bombay Palace",234,"Anna Sanders",227,"a month ago",1,"Nan is thick and stodgy! (Nothing like the photos)
Condiments are all full of sugar!
Chips undercooked!
Rice was good!
The chicken itself was good, the sauce bland - similar to a kebab shop!

Indian food isn‚Äôt complicated to make at all, just requires a lot of spices‚Ä¶ so to pay so much and to get a basic, below par quality and taste indicates to me the restaurant doesn‚Äôt care and is more concerned with quick margins than repeat business!"
"Bombay Palace",234,"Giorgio Berardi",967,"a year ago",3,"I must say that I was a bit baffled by the previous recent reviews, some of which were ravingly positive, with others simply horrified. We decided to give it a go anyway.
On the plus side, service was prompt and attentive, and we liked most of the food we ordered. I found my Chicken Madras especially good.
On the minus front, the place was still freezing two good hours after opening time. We had a heating element next to us, but the staff did not realise it was not plugged in. At times, the staff gave the slight impression of having been hurled into the job on the day before, but they were showing their good will anyway. I found my son's Butter Chicken far too bland and tasting exceedingly of - well, yes - butter, but he enjoyed it nonetheless.
I read others complain about an overpriced menu, but I have to say that, after scouring the Cork scene of Indian restaurants, Bombay Palace actually has slightly lower rates than most other comparable places (although the prices shown on their website have already been touched up).
Room for improvement, but I'm sure they are trying."
"Bombay Palace",234,"Angela",212,"9 months ago",5,"Quiet, elegant and comfy restaurant. They always provide great and professional service. Any time I go without a booking they always try their best to accommodate us as soon as possible. The food and the drinks are always great and the portions are perfect for sharing. Even if the restaurant is in the city centre, you can always find peace here. They gave us a 5 euros voucher after having dinner there."
"Bombay Palace",234,"Lidka G√°tarek",1513,"Edited 2 years ago",5,"I read many mixed review so I decided to check on my own. Food was not only tasty but portion was big enough to made me stuffed. Service was also good- from the young waiter to the female-owner. I ordered off menu and they prepared for me special meal. Definitely will visit again."
"Bombay Palace",234,"Narashima P",1847,"Edited 4 months ago",3,"I have been to this place quite a few times. Being a vegetarian, there are limited options, and the quantity of curry is too low for the price. Some of the restaurants serve a bowl of plain basmati rice with the curry, but this place doesn't. It seems expensive, and even a portion is moderate."
"Bombay Palace",234,"Nini",1912,"9 months ago",5,"The Indian cuisine is excellent here, I ordered the Balti Chicken and wow the flavours were delicious with lots of chicken,the rice & Nan bread is also great, I love the atmosphere here it‚Äôs a cosy place, it was very busy when we walked in Christmas week so there was a wait but it was worth it, as a very fussy Indian food lover I would highly recommend Bombay Palace"
"Caf√© Gusto",235,"J S",1111,"3 months ago",5,"Went in for midweek breakfast, everything was delicious and came out quickly! The staff were very friendly as well.

There are around 8 small tables so I imagine it gets busy at the weekend. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this spot for breakfast if you don‚Äôt mind a limited menu!"
"Caf√© Gusto",235,"Flower Petal",891,"2 months ago",2,"My top 5 places to eat in Cork during the day. Today was a big disappointment though when I decided to sample the hot dish special‚ÄôKerala Chicken curry‚Äô.instead of a salad. The dish was  soup with chicken and rice. The portion size was smaller than usual. .

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this in the otherwise amazing quality and well-priced menu (not as a curry anyway)."
"Caf√© Gusto",235,"Alexis Creedy",134,"2 years ago",5,"A great stop for early birds and jet-lagged travelers, as they open an hour or two earlier than most places!

"Caf√© Gusto",235,"cowgirlitron Boland",575,"3 months ago",2,"Disappointing. Coffee was good but waited 20 mins for my poached eggs on sourdough, meanwhile at least 5 people who arrived after me were served their food. When the food did eventually arrive (without apologies for the lateness), the poached eggs were hard."
"The Crane Lane Theatre",342,"aaron cowming",20,"a month ago",5,"The best venue in cork, cool vibe, plenty of live music, latino nights, cabaret the works. Great crowd, never any trouble or issues. Bar crew are the best. Food is sensational. The only place in cork i frequent every week."
"Sicilian Delights",346,"emma reynolds",818,"5 days ago",5,"AMAZING NAPOLI STYLE FOOD. Pretty good prices for this area and the service from Sonya was amazing. So accommodating and sweet!

"Caf√© Gusto",235,"Reviewer-Elisabeth",2112,"4 months ago",1,"Honestly do not recommend this place. I was hungry and I couldn't even eat the food fully. I went it to the till  it took the 2 servers a while as it seemed like neither of them wanted to serve me. I ordered a sandwich and a cup of tea. The tea was fab but that is the most easy thing. Now the sandwich I think it was the flying bacon oh Jesus christ. I asked for ciabatta bread the bread I got i don't know what it was but it was rock hard I don't know if the sandwich was supposed to be hot or cold. As the cheese was melted at the edges and  the outside tasted warmish while the middle was cold, the ingredients didn't feel fresh like the tomato in it felt like it had been in the sandwich for a while. It tasted disgusting and left a bad taste in my mouth even a few minutes after. I couldn't eat it. The place looks okay it just needs a few improvements"
"Caf√© Gusto",235,"Callum Young",410,"2 years ago",5,"Delicious spot for some breakfast, brunch, and lunch.

I've been wanting to go in for a long time, and I am so glad we finally visited.

Great breakfast options, steering away from your usual full irish, fresh produce and amazing, well cooked eggs with just the right amount of seasoning and not too wet or too dry.

Delicious coffee and the Organic A√ßa√≠ Smoothie in a bowl is such a nice touch!

Prices are also very competitive at just ‚Ç¨7 for the portions you receive is amazing!"

"Cork & Fork",236,"J S",1111,"3 months ago",5,"Beautiful restaurant and welcoming staff. The food was delicious and served quickly.

The potato and leek soup was amazing, it came with homemade Guinness soda bread which was unreal.

The salmon was cooked beautifully and the ratatouille and potato wedges were flavorful. The steak sandwich plate was loaded with chips and a refreshing salad/coleslaw combo.

The only downside was they were playing dance/club music which didn‚Äôt quite fit with the atmosphere and was quite loud.

Highly recommend stopping in for lunch if you wouldn‚Äôt mind the music!"
"Cork & Fork",236,"Samuel Jackson",2231,"a month ago",5,"It was the best pasta I have ever eaten. The service was outstanding and everyone was very polite and respectful. If you had only one day to spend in cork and you needed a place to eat, this is the place that you cannot miss. Whenever I come back to Ireland I will be going to cork just to have the pasta again"
"Cork & Fork",236,"Jessica Ellem",1210,"a month ago",5,"A lovely and cozy restaurant tucked behind one of the busy streets of Cork. And one of the best meals I've had in Ireland (I've had some good ones too). The duck breast was really cooked to perfection with a really nice apple sauce/puree and perfectly cooked carrots. My husband had the chorizo rigatoni dish that he enjoyed and we split a black forest cake to end. I wish I had ordered my own. The waiter says friendly, and service was timely. Highly recommend if you're looking for high quality food at a fair price."

"Cork & Fork",236,"Coucou Ola",573,"11 months ago",5,"Great food, happy team and the kitchen are open, so no bad surprise. A really great time in this small quality restaurant.

Very good food and experience"

Definitely a go to/must visit if you are in Cork. It has very quickly become one of my favourite restaurants to visit!"
"Cork & Fork",236,"Steph anie",2380,"2 months ago",5,"I had the goatscheese burger and my friend the pasta with chicken and chorizo. Both were great. The burger had onion and cranberry sauce which complimented the goats cheese beautifully. The pasta was cooked al dente and the sauce was a delight. The restaurant itself is welcoming and tends to be booked out (since eating there i know why) so I'd reserve a table if I was you. Definitely a must if you're in Cork!"
"Three Fools Grand Parade",237,"Sarah O‚ÄôReilly",2264,"2 months ago",4,"Very nice coffee but quite pricey. The coffee cup on display was definitely bigger than the one we got. We didn‚Äôt get food but the pastries looked very tasty."

They have seating outside  and indoors"
"Cornstore Cork",38,"Ann Murray",220,"a month ago",5,"One of our favourite places to eat, scrumptious food and lovely staff. My husband had the ribeye steak with a side of beef dripping chips and I had the risotto and a side of Caf√© de Paris wedges, absolutely delicious."

"Bellini's Restaurant",238,"Thomas Clarke",2479,"3 years ago",5,"Outstanding !!! And that should be the full review, but that wouldn‚Äôt be fair to anyone especially all the lovely people working hard making this such a treat. I was here 2 years ago and the place just opened following Covid and to be honest they struggled. Before that we were here in 2010 and loved it so in 2022 we thought we would give it another go, so happy we did because they are back and better than ever. My wife and I had the scallops for starters and my daughter had the garlic bread and needless to say everything was gorgeous. I had the lamb and the wife had the duck and we both had a spiced potato side which was üî• but delicious. My daughter had the pasta which she very much enjoyed with a lovely mock tail. My wife and I both had sticky toffee pudding with salted caramel ice cream, which was out of this world, and my daughter had the sorbet. We finished with lovely smooth coffees and happy smiles all round. I can‚Äôt fault anything the staff were so friendly and didn‚Äôt miss a beat. They are friendly and have great information about what to do in the area. Seating is comfortable atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming and loads of free parking outside. Yes you will pay top dollar but it‚Äôs worth it honestly and I have no doubt you will also leave happy."
"Bellini's Restaurant",238,"Myrlia Purcell",1838,"a year ago",5,"My husband and I celebrated our 20th anniversary here, and it was such a perfect evening. We were pampered and looked after very well, yet there was never a sense of intrusion. We had a lovely corner table that felt private and quiet enough to converse, and the music that was playing was the perfect volume to add to the atmosphere without grabbing attention or being difficult to speak over.
The food was all beautifully presented, and we particularly loved the starters and the vegetarian main. We're looking forward to returning another time!"
"Bellini's Restaurant",238,"Lisa Clarke",1526,"3 years ago",5,"On arrival you are welcomed with a smile. Our table was spacious, not too close to anyone else and nicely laid with a tealight and flower. The menu wasn't massive but had a good selection and variety. My husband and myself both got the scallops for starters and they were cooked perfectly and very tasty. My daughter had the cheesey garlic bread and she devoured it. For mains I had the Duck with potato gratins, rhubarb and cherry. It was so good and the little pop those cheeries brought to the dish was absolutely amazing. My husband had the Lamb and said it was tender and delicious. My daughter had the fettuccine pasta, even though she managed to make a mess she loved it and eat every bit. The barman was kind enough to make my daughter a moctail and she was over the moon with it. La pi√®ce de r√©sistance was dessert, we both had the cr√©me de la crime, the Sticky Toffee Pudding, with butterscotch sauce and caramel ice cream....... omg.... to die for, it was that good the following evening it was on the bar menu and all 3 of us know what we were having for dessert before we had even looked at the actual food lol. My daughter had the sorbet, a scoop of raspberry and a scoop of mango, they were very good. Over all the food was simply amazing, I don't have a negative for anything, it was that good, every plate was cleared of food. The staff on the night where so friendly, there was no rush, they took their time and even stopped for chat to inquire about you plans for the next day and gave us some great tips about what we were planning. The whole atmosphere was relaxed that mixed with great service and amazing food just finished our evening off on a high. If your staying at the hotel or even if you in the area its so worth a visit if your a foodie."
"Bellini's Restaurant",238,"Bojan Tubin",355,"3 years ago",5,"The food was exceptional, from starter to dessert.
The staff were very helpful and hospitable.  Our server (I think Saoirse, not 100% sure) was super attentive and very bubbly.
We also stayed for cocktails at the hotel bar which were fabulously crafted by Conor, he's a true artist with the shaker!"
"Bellini's Restaurant",238,"Berke In",334,"8 months ago",3,"We visited this restaurant to celebrate our first anniversary, but unfortunately, our experience was disappointing. I initially ordered a steak but was served beef instead. While they replaced it, I had to wait around 10 minutes, leaving my wife eating alone, and her meal got cold. The steak I received was not cooked medium well as I requested, and the overall food quality was underwhelming.

On a positive note, the staff was attentive, and the manager kindly offered us complimentary champagne, which we appreciated. However, the atmosphere was lackluster, and the food didn‚Äôt meet our expectations."
"Bellini's Restaurant",238,"Natasha Johnston",1856,"a year ago",3,"The food here was excellent however the service was a little poor. We were seated and given 1 menu between us and promptly offered drinks but we were overlooked several times when attempting to get the waiters attention to order food. He seemed more interested in attending to the large group seated next to us. Service was very slow as a result."
"The MET Bar & Restaurant",250,"AJ Park",91,"2 years ago",5,"The presentation of the food was really thoughtful. We ordered the brie, pork belly, steak, salad and sorbet for dessert."
"Bellini's Restaurant",238,"Chris",471,"2 years ago",5,"Absolutely fantastic meal at Bellini's Bar (not the Restaurant) - best food we had in Ireland by a long way.

There was a traditional music session happening that night so we only had standing room at the bar counter. You can soak up the atmosphere of this bar from anywhere inside and we had a wonderful evening with our friends in Callanan's!

The Staff:
The staff are very friendly here and the service is very quick. They like a bit of chat too and are a wealth of information if you get talking to them when its quiet.

Layout:
The layout of the bar is pretty simplistic. There is esentially just one main room with a little snug at the front on the right as you enter. There is a little room at the back of the bar however, it is very small and only has a few tables and chairs.
The bar counter is located in the main room at the right hand side and the seating along with tables are mainly along left hand side of the room.
The snug like all other snugs can only take 4 or 5 people but if you are lucky to get into it not only will you have your own seperate access to the bar but its probably the best place to sit in the bar in general.

Decor:
Callanan's is another one of Cork's old timey bars and it is decorated in such fashion too. The walls are lined with timber panelling and there are a couple of pictures dotted along the walls however, the decorating is kepth mostly plain and simple.
There are no tvs in this bar which is nice as this bar is where people come for conversation and a few sociables!

Pop Up Gaeltacht:
I came here once in my college days as a few friends were Irish speakers and they had heard about the Pop Up Gaeltacht that was taking in Callanan's that particular night.
It was a brilliant experience to talk and share stories with people who ranged from basic conversation to a fluent grasp of the Irish language and ever since then I have wanted to come back.
I asked the bar man when I visited a few weeks ago if the Pop Up Gaeltacht was still going and sure enough it was being held that very night in another pub in Cork city.
If you are interested check out PopUpGaeltacht on Instagram or Facebook.

Location:
Its located on the corner of Mary St. and George's Quay oppiste Parliament Bridge.

Overall Opinion:
I highly recommend stopping by Callanan's Bar for a pint of Murphy's and Beamish and the pints were flowing the night we were here.
If Guinness is more your thing, they have bottles of Guinness that you can order. Apparently a warm bottle of Guinness is a thing so I must give it a try.
I would give Callanan's Bar 8.5 out of 10!"
"Callanan's Bar",239,"Matt Morris",1707,"8 months ago",5,"The most Corkonian pub. No Guinness, just local stuff & when Beamish is far superior anyway, it's really excellent. Very Irish decor & feel. Easily the cheapest pint within the City Centre area & hand on heart, the best pints you will get in the City. The regulars & the owner were absolutely fantastic people, made us two blokes from Stoke very welcome. Absolutely loved this place."
"Callanan's Bar",239,"John √ì R√≠ord√°in",1268,"Edited a month ago",5,"Friendly staff. Friendly crowd. Great whiskey selection. Great stout. A real traditional Irish pub. You could be in any village or town in Cork when you step in there."
"Callanan's Bar",239,"Donovan",741,"Edited 7 months ago",5,"Assuming pints fall under the ""food"" category, then there is no better. If you're lucky enough to get a seat in this place, then you're set for the night! Can't top it."
"Callanan's Bar",239,"Eoin Doyle",833,"3 weeks ago",5,"Always a great atmosphere in here and it's one of the best value pint of Beamish in Cork."

"Callanan's Bar",239,"Ross Dons",2185,"a year ago",5,"Incredible Beamish! If you get a pint of something else you should be tarred and feathered, and in stocks on the grand parade!"
"Callanan's Bar",239,"Billy Sheehan",346,"8 years ago",5,"Lovely traditional old pub. Fantastic pints and probably the cheapest Murphy's in town centre."
"Yuan Ming Yuan",240,"Emma Figueras",816,"a month ago",5,"Everything was amazing and the staff were very kind to recommend us different options, would definitely recommend.
Service was very fast as well and most dishes come with a side of rice/chips."
"Yuan Ming Yuan",240,"Karan Samani",1344,"3 weeks ago",5,"Probably the best Chinese food I've had in Cork. The aromatic duck was delicious and came with a lotta meat and veggies.

For dessert they don't have a menu but have ice cream or a chocolate cake with cream. The cake was once again one of the best I've had. Moist and chocolatey!

We did have an ""accompaniment"" fee added to our table of 4 (3 euros per person) which presumably was the service fee."
"Yuan Ming Yuan",240,"O. P.",1928,"3 months ago",5,"I know authentic Chinese dimsum and this is the best I've had in Europe, and I lived a bit everywhere. All of it seemed freshly made and was as good as one can possibly hope. Salt and pepper squid was the best I ever had, including in China!"
"Yuan Ming Yuan",240,"David Aherne",654,"2 months ago",3,"Visited on Sunday evening. The food was really good. The service was really good. I was a bit taken a back though when I was leaving,after already paying at the counter  when i was exiting the waitress said "" have ye paid? "" . Found that to be a little bit Insensitive having already paid the bill üëÄ  As a manager in a customer service facing role I certainly would not be nor be recommending my staff to deem that to be an appropriate way to approach a customer . Did I need to have the receipt in full view of the waitress when I was leaving  only because she didn't see me pay ?   Please look into this for yourselves going forward.    As I said food was lovely though outside of that and the other staff were great thoroughout our time there. Would of been 5 star only for the end of the experience"
"Caf√© Velo",5,"Joanna Renata Mikolajczyk",1234,"6 days ago",5,"Today I went to Velo Caf√©, totally exhausted and struggling with the weather. I had a big buggy and wanted to sit outside. But the lovely lady invited me to take a seat. I just got green tea, nothing else, but the treated us like a VIP client. I was able to feed the toddler and just got a break from my day. I'll be coming back here because the staff is absolutely lovely. Reny&Jude"
"Yuan Ming Yuan",240,"Jaee Sakhalkar",1132,"10 months ago",3,"Food: Food was pretty decent. We had steamed prawn dumplings and they are absolutely authentic. I would have liked the size of the dumplings to be larger, but taste wise, they nailed it. We also ordered chicken in schezwan sauce and egg fried rice, it was absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend this dish, it‚Äôll give a nice taste to your palette. The hot and sour chicken soup was okay.

Service: Whilst the food was great, we found  however the service to be a bit slow.

Ambience: Ambience is really good and gives out cozy yet authentic vibes.

Overall, it was a pretty decent experience."
"Yuan Ming Yuan",240,"Kwang Sujinno",1460,"Edited 9 months ago",5,"I tried the Cantonese roast duck in mala sauce, recommended by the staff and it was delicious. The duck was fresh and cooked to order, unlike some other places where it tastes pre-cooked. You can really taste the quality and freshness here."
"Yuan Ming Yuan",240,"Jasmine J",1167,"a month ago",5,"Authentic Chinese food in Cork! I‚Äôm from Singapore and had the best sweet & sour pork ever right here. The seafood hot pot was delicious too. And the steam rice was so soft and fragrant. The lovely lady boss made the whole experience warm and memorable. Highly recommended!!"
"Yuan Ming Yuan",240,"Arjun Pakrashi",272,"a year ago",5,"This was a great discovery. We got chicken and mushroom soup, the dumpling platter which had four types of dumplings, two each and for the mains, stir fry with cashew nuts, and stir fried noodles.

I liked all of the items and enjoyed them. I can't comment about whether they are authentic Chinese or not, the food was very very enjoyable for me. It's a great value for money Chinese place in Cork.

Can't post the dumpling picture as Google is flagging that picture."
"Yuan Ming Yuan",240,"Se√°n Tynan",2298,"a year ago",5,"Beauty, cozy interior, perfect to relax in with tea and dim sum. The tea itself had an amazing flavour and worth going for alone.

Exquisitely juicy and flavoursome Steamed Pork Dumplings. Definitely one of my favourites along with the Grilled Pork Dumpling with Chinese Vinegar.

The service is friendly, efficient, and not overly intrusive."
"Yuan Ming Yuan",240,"Sneha George",2354,"a year ago",5,"Absolutely loved the food here. We tried the Duck Cantonese style in soy sauce and the brown sauce Pork belly and it was amazing flavours all packed in both the dishes. They also served a side of fried rice with the dishes. Loved it üëçüèΩ"

"Freestyle Asian Food",242,"Kristen Cornelio",1448,"7 months ago",5,"My husband and I got out of seeing a movie and were hungry and discovered this restaurant. We showed up just about 30 minutes to close and we were greeted with a warm welcome and didn‚Äôt feel rushed at all.

I ordered the chicken curry with the fried rice. My dish was freshly made, flavorful, and loaded with flavor. I‚Äôm glad we stumbled upon this restaurant, it really hit the spot.

100% recommend this place for a meal. The fried rice is a small up charge but is worth it, my husband and I both enjoyed the fried rice side.

Friendly and welcoming customer service too!"
"Freestyle Asian Food",242,"Gitta D√©vai",973,"4 months ago",5,"Wonderful dumplings here, the sauce is fantastic and you get 16 dumplings, for a very fair price. The service is very friendly. We will be back for sure."
"Freestyle Asian Food",242,"Helio Baeten",1043,"a year ago",5,"We went to this restaurant on a sunday at three o‚Äôclock.
We ordered a few dishes for all less than ‚Ç¨15 each, and just 5 minutes later they brought our food, which was some of the best authentic Chinese food I‚Äôve ever had. The portion sizes, even though we only got one dish per person, were so big that we couldn‚Äôt finish our food. The staff was very friendly and the restaurant had a cute relaxed vibe. I give this place a 10/10: low prices, big portion sizes, fast service, very friendly staff and an amazing experience overall."
"Freestyle Asian Food",242,"Eli",786,"3 weeks ago",5,"I went to Freestyle Asian Food after moving to Cork City and was surprised and delighted with the quality and authenticity of the food served. They also provide a Western menu which u haven't tasted but the traditional menu was so good! Went back only a couple of days later
Highly recommend"
"Freestyle Asian Food",242,"tang Chaney",2439,"2 months ago",5,"I came here with a friend one evening after wandering around looking for a place to eat ‚Äî totally unplanned, but it turned out to be a great surprise.

I ordered the braised beef noodle, and it completely hit the spot. The beef was tender and full of flavor, perfectly slow-cooked ‚Äî not dry at all. The noodles had a nice chewy texture, just the way I like them, and the broth was rich and flavorful without being too salty. I honestly couldn‚Äôt stop eating.

Service was excellent, too. We showed up close to closing time, but the staff were really friendly and didn‚Äôt rush us at all. It felt welcoming and relaxed the whole time we were there.

The atmosphere was quiet and clean, with plenty of space to sit and talk. Whether you‚Äôre dining solo, with a friend, or in a small group, this place works well."
"Freestyle Asian Food",242,"Sebastiane Pereiro",2302,"Edited 2 months ago",4,"I ordered an appetizer of spicy squid, it was brought beautifully, but it tasted like bland fatty batter, maybe she can cook other dishes, but I don't recommend squid to you"

"Freestyle Asian Food",242,"Sophie Ann",2362,"2 months ago",3,"The Spice Box was really promising  great concept and lovely presentation. With better seasoning, it would easily be a 10/10. However, the satay tasted a bit off, which let the dish down overall. Hoping it was a one off because I‚Äôd love to try it again once those flavour issues are sorted."
"Ryan's Caf√©",243,"Kevin McMahon",1428,"3 months ago",5,"Absolutely delighted this cafe is back open. Absolute quality, had the Paul‚Äôs special sandwich which was accompanied with a fresh salad and crisps. Absolutely superb and the coffee was delicious."
"The Poor Relation",260,"Kevin M.",1425,"3 months ago",2,"This place used to be great. It was one of my go to bars in Cork.

Sad it's gone like this."
"Ryan's Caf√©",243,"Run Wang (Raymond)",2195,"2 years ago",5,"Just notice this brilliant cafe in Grange.
Love the aromatic coffee and friendly staff. Deserve a finicky lunch meal hot pot special, thanks for Kelly‚Äôs advice.

"Ryan's Caf√©",243,"dionne furlong",727,"2 years ago",4,"This place is local to me,nice to have a good local cafe without having to go to the village. I usually go for breakfast but sometimes the scrambled eggs can vary in portion size and they could be more fluffy but okay overall,  also I had the Chicken salad  for lunch very nice and plenty of it. Nice place for a catch up but could be sound proofed a bit better as the noise does travel. üòê"
"Ryan's Caf√©",243,"Sean Carroll",2283,"a year ago",5,"What a üíé gem. Lovely cafe in the heart of Grange. Easy parking. The menu has good options for breakfast and lunch. There is a friendly atmosphere with pleasant staff. Their pricing is realistic and represents good value for money."

It has a warm and welcoming environment with friendly staff, especially Breda who will always make time to come over and chat with you and check in to see if everything is alright. There is also a great selection of food and cakes to choose from which never disappoints (Would highly recommend the new toasted panini that is new to the menu)."

Staff were very friendly and welcoming also. Definitely a spot I‚Äôd recommend."
"Carved Cafe",244,"Denis Murphy",708,"a month ago",5,"Incredible place for a sandwich - I had the breakfast sandwich and it was the best I‚Äôve had in Cork
Got the cookies too and they were amazing
Only thing is it‚Äôs a bit on the pricy side but the quality is brilliant"
"Carved Cafe",244,"Sarah Jennings",2257,"a month ago",4,"Was expecting better as the toastie wasnt toasted enough but it was quite busy and all the other toasties were toasted i guess we were just unlucky with ares was very taste though got a cookie straight out of the oven. We got the Cinamon crumble stuffed one was very good and very sweet but as expected. We got the pulled pork one."
"Carved Cafe",244,"Liz Donovan",1533,"a month ago",4,"Arrived at 11:30am and was quite surprised at the lack of variety available to choose from. Only toasties that were available were ham and cheese, Cajun chicken and turkey. Only one flavoured cookie available - kinder. We still ordered as we had already made the journey there. Toasties were delicious and the iced coffee was lovely aswell. Hoping to visit again as we‚Äôve been wanting to try other flavours. The guy working there was also very friendly."
"Carved Cafe",244,"Se√°n Mac Dermot",2292,"a month ago",2,"Heard great things on social media. The food was nice, ordered a toastie and two cookies but when I asked for specific ‚Ç¨4 cookie, I was told they are all the same by a very rude woman working there when the one she tried giving us was completely squashed looking so of course we want a fresh one when paying for an item. We will hopefully be met with a friendly and more professional person the next time we come."
"Carved Cafe",244,"Sarah Dunne",2253,"2 weeks ago",5,"We decided to try this cafe as we were passing on our Sunday spin last week. It was a bit later in the day and the selection had lessened but we were still happy with our choices of Vegetarian Pesto and Ham & Cheese. Staff are pleasant and kept going as expected, it was busy, but worth the wait. Toasties were very filling and we got a cookie for later, Malteser Caramel, which was divine. Look forward to returning and trying more. Well worth a visit! Nice to see seating outside the cafe and bins provided also."
"Carved Cafe",244,"Sarah Hayes",2254,"a month ago",5,"These sandwiches are simply divine. I‚Äôve tried 4 different ones now and each one as nice as the other, the siracha melt being my favourite. Cookies are also 10/10. Would highly recommend."

"CRUST",245,"Thierry Douin",2473,"4 months ago",5,"We wanted to have a light dinner and opted for a Pizza. Crust, highly rated online, happened to be close to our hotel so we gave it a try. This outlet opened a little over 2 years and is really busy. My wife ordered the ham and mushroom and I had the Buffalina. Both were excellent served on a thin and crispy crust. For dessert we shared a  Baileys Cheese Cake which did taste Baileys!! Overall highly recommended."
"CRUST",245,"George Cross",943,"4 months ago",5,"Absolutely fantastic. Came here a week ago for the first time and enjoyed it so much, was counting the days to come back. Back here now and even better this time round. Food was so fresh and tasty, it‚Äôs my new favourite place.service was first class and Jim the boss man was so friendly,  he made me feels so welcome and took the time for a fantastic chat.

I can only say good things about this place. Wish it was closer to home

Thankyou Jim, you got a good place here"
"Greenwich",247,"Orla Mooney",1954,"2 months ago",5,"I found this spot on a visit to Cork a few years ago and was delighted to find it again two weeks ago. We went both mornings of our stay. The food was delicious on all three visits. One of the best breakfasts I've had anywhere in Ireland. There's a reason why it is always full of people! Staff were lovely too, including the owner."
"CRUST",245,"Robert Schuppert-McDonald",2149,"a month ago",4,"I ordered 2 pizzas through Deliveroo from Crust Pizza and this didn't match the quality when I originally ate at the pizzeria (keeping in mind that the store doesn't have control over my choice for delivery service). A pity since I did enjoy their pizza. Maybe an off night all around but I expected better. The pepperoni pizza was overdone and ham and mushroom needed more time in oven. BTW: for clarity this is an edited review. I did get a call from the shop to apologize and that was very much appriciated. Especially since my past visit was a completely different experience. I accepted the return invitation and will update my review accordingly."
"CRUST",245,"Paul Richard Bungay",2018,"8 months ago",5,"I always wanted to visit this place and I can say it was worth visiting. I told them that it was our first time visiting and they recommended the Sweet Chili Bacon. They even offered that if we ordered a 12‚Äù pizza we can do another flavor so it‚Äôs half and half. Service was good and the food was great too! Food is freshly prepared and they make it when you order it so its hot hot hot! Great experience!"
"CRUST",245,"Mark Buczynski",1649,"a month ago",1,"Read the reviews and people raved about this place being the best in all of Ireland. These reviews prompted me to try and let me tell you, absolutely awful pizza. All these people stating how great it is, don‚Äôt know pizza.
Service was great and the guys behind the counter were very nice but very thin crust, more like crackers and minimal toppings."
"CRUST",245,"Francisco Zeno Jr",902,"3 months ago",3,"I am actually giving it a 3 1/2 star rating as far as food. I had the calzone ( The Margherita), I‚Äôll go back for more, ate the crust and all. Location is also good."

The service was quick and friendly, which made the whole experience even better. It had a relaxed, welcoming vibe that made it perfect for a casual stop. Sometimes the best meals are the ones you don‚Äôt plan, and this was definitely one of those pleasant surprises.

If you‚Äôre in Cork and craving something delicious without the wait, Crust is a must-try!"
"CRUST",245,"War Pig",2596,"8 months ago",3,"Very friendly service but for my taste the pizza was over cooked. It was dry rather than crispy. Maybe some folk like it like that but didn't do it for me.

"CRUST",245,"Shelley Curley",2325,"a month ago",5,"We loved our dining experience at CRUST! The owner waited on us, and checked on us, and took time to chat with us. Pizza and drinks were delicious. We would definitely recommend this little Gem to others."
"CRUST",245,"Alfredo Morieri",137,"8 months ago",5,"Finally! Hands down, the best pizza in town. Their dough is exceptional‚Äîcrispy and flavorful, a refreshing change from the soft crusts often associated with Neapolitan-style pizza.

"Restaurant 14a",246,"Igor Ara√∫jo",1074,"2 years ago",5,"Wow, I have to say that the burgers here are amazing! They use real meat, and it tastes so much better than the junk food you get elsewhere.

If you're looking for a real burger experience in Cork, this is the place to be!"
"Restaurant 14a",246,"Sascha Giese",2267,"6 years ago",3,"So-so breakfast. The interior is actually nice and shows some effort. The staff is nice, service quick enough. Now, the sausages and the black/white pudding were of seriously good quality, think of Blackrock Castle. Unfortunately the toast was, we'll, over toasted and black on one side. The bacon also fried too long, hard and dry. On the other hand the fried egg was sitting somewhere and arrived cold. The coffee was basic. Won't go here again considering there are much better places. But there's worse, as well."

Each time, the food has been lovely and tasted homemade; the staff have been polite and friendly (more than in most restaurants); and the tables/floor/bathrooms have been clean. I like the vintage decor, location, and I think the prices are on the lower end, by and large. If you're looking for somewhere to have lunch in Cork today, this would be one of my go-to places."

"Restaurant 14a",246,"Alan Foy",98,"4 months ago",1,"SEND MANAGER ON A CUSTOMER TRAINING COURSE. The guy would not listen to my partner who had genuine concerns about how the food was cooked. He didn‚Äôt care, he still charged full price when food was barely touched. It‚Äôs a dingey, dark depressing place and this manager is clueless and needs a change of career. The floor staff were lovely, it must be tough working with that guy all day. AVOID."

"Greenwich",247,"Taylor Sexton",2455,"a year ago",5,"Came here for Sunday brunch on a whim because the menu options really grabbed my attention. The Blackened Chicken salad had so much flavour I was really surprised at how delicious it was. I also got the Apple crumble French toast (always have to have sweet and savoury!) and wow wow wow.. I will be back for this!
The lemon curd and blueberry pancakes also sounded delicious, this was I‚Äôll be my next to try. Cappuccino was also delicious. The servers were also super friendly, and even ran after me when I forgot my bag (whoops)"

I ordered a French toast and decided to add an order of sausages, which I ended up, not eating because of portions were large. We went in with two adults and a stroller (buggy) and sta inside- small space but was just enough. The service was great and so was the holiday cheer. We will define coming back to the place.

The toilets are located outside."

Top notch food and service. Only problem I had was the way the owner spoke to the staff. He was very snappy and made us uncomfortable and you could see on the faces of the staff, it wasn‚Äôt his first time acting like that. The staff were amazing, so welcoming and polite. Whilst the food is wonderful and well presented it‚Äôs not a place I‚Äôll go back to again due to the owners behaviour"

Companion had the apple french toast - she reckoned it was more a dessert than a breakfast - too sweet and ‚Äútoo much going on‚Äù.
The service and the welcome were excellent - that gives it two stars instead of one."

"The Kingsley Hotel",249,"Sun Lee",2417,NULL,NULL,"Beautiful hotel on the river away from Downtown Cork; room furniture and interior need an update to receive a four star rating. The amenities available is why this has such a high rating.

This 4-star hotel does not come with a fridge in your room; nor a phone to call the receptionist

Our room was very large and spacious with plenty of room for luggage, toiletries and a table with chair to sit at. The room furniture felt a bit dated and showed some wear whereas the lobby and dining room felt nicely furnished and well maintained.

The staff was very friendly and hard working.

The hotel does offer bicycles to ride along the River Lee.

The gym facilities and pool are wonderful- the sauna is always a good temperature. It‚Äôs in a great location, right by the river.

I called last minute and the gentleman at reception, Brian, couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. They didn‚Äôt have a room available and we needed a dog friendly room in cork. He even offered to phone other hotels to check -  bear in mind that we weren‚Äôt staying at this stage. Super hospitality!
In the end we got a room as there was a last minute cancellation.
From the moment we entered we were treated in such a lovely manner from all the staff we encountered. I am a bit ‚Äúdog mad‚Äù so I was really impressed by how they treat doggies here - the welcome pack (treats, toys and a bandana for the dog), the lovely dog beds and blankets in the room and the fact my beloved dogs could hang out in most areas was a welcome treat ! I have stayed in most dog friendly hotels and even the 5 stars aren‚Äôt as good to doggies as the Kingsley. Made it all the more special for us. At the same time, if you don‚Äôt like dogs, there is a strict policy so other dogs wouldn‚Äôt bother you in the common areas.
Breakfast was stunning - great selection in the buffet and breakfast made to order.

The chicken wings weren't fresh, they were just reheated.

Be sure to check the bill at the end. Instead of charging us for two glasses of wine, they charged us for two bottles.

The Duty manger that was on was an absolute üíØ credit to the the place. If I had a business of my own I would definitely try to poach her as she was an absolute trojan. She restructured our booking and literally asked us were we okay for everything on a frequent basis through out the night. As it was the stag of my brother in law and we planned on going bowling but unfortunately that didn't go to plan. The Duty manger I think if memory serves me right her name was Marion brought us out our food which to be honest was off the chain unbelievable. Top notch food and to finalise what I'm saying, They were very accommodating and made us feeling even though they're was a minor issue made us feel as if we were VIPs and to be honest they're was no need.

They cater for hen and stag parties where you can have your own private area all to yourself .

It‚Äôs one of the nicest pubs I‚Äôve been in in a long time the food is fantastic the atmosphere is great super location right in the centre of Cork city .

All the staff got together in Covid and did the pub  up  and put their own personal touch and colour and positive happy joyful cheerful feel to the place .

Service was slow, most of our group did the bottomless. We had to ask to be topped up. Only after 45 minutes did we get an unprompted top-up. This pattern continued throughout, staff just disappeared for long periods.
Staff were nice and friendly though, it seemed more of a management issue.
The food was limited. Just chicken dishes, or a waffle dish. No eggs on a brunch menu?? Come on.
We had to repeatedly ask for basic things like ketchup, salt, water, etc.
The bar was a little run down, the table was dirty and the mens toilets stank badly.
At the end of the meal we were also overcharged, which they did refund when we poinged it out.

Whether visiting for chips, dinner, pints, cocktails, spirits, the spirit of the venue itself, a match, some light music and a chat with friend(s) this place tends to deliver‚Ä¶ very rarely have I come away thinking I should have gone somewhere else. The staff are fierce professional and even allow some of their personality to shine through at times when serving tables. Yet to get to know anyone by name really but have ended up somewhat a regular overtime over the whole package on offer at this place.
With two separate menus for food entirely, depending on which entrance you enter into (but the same group of staff managing both), you‚Äôre sure to find something you like whether you‚Äôre in for quick bite, a drink and a small bite, a full dinner or a coffee/tea and a bit of sport in a television / to listen to some light music.

Bar makeovers are difficult; this one, however,  has been completely successful.  It has been so successful that this bar is as good as anything you'll find city centre without the hassle of going city centre queuing and the like.  It incorporates a central entrance that also functions as a cafe. The coffee is excellent and this is matched by high quality pub food. The lighting and layout are well thought out and late night entertainment is also on a par with anything you'll get city centre.

"Milano",254,"Abbi Keane",26,"5 months ago",4,"Food was amazing, really quick service and great atmosphere. Lovely server but when taking our starters away he put back our used cutlery onto the table which I thought was strange not a dealbreaker though. The tipping process was uncomfortable as the server just turned around and stood standing beside us as we entered the amount. Great experience otherwise and would go back regardless :)"
"Milano",254,"Solano Gadanha",2358,"3 weeks ago",3,"Service was great, nice atmosphere, but I was a bit disappointed with the food, usually we have pasta and pizza, no problem, but this time I have tried their sea food and polenta chips. The battered calamari wasn't crispy and it had that thin skin that can be annoying, the polenta chips were mushy, not well fried and the prawns overall was okay, but they were so tiny that I couldn't barely taste it,that is definetely not the standard I would expect for Milano."
"Milano",254,"Jan Forgreenever",1160,"3 months ago",5,"Great stuff. Great food and atmosphere. But service takes too long sometimes. But there is always seems to be really busy so it's understandable üòÉ Recommended"
"Milano",254,"Mr. Shah",1830,"2 years ago",4,"Good ambience and wide menu. They also have a vegetarian menu and have amazing sides and pizza üçï. Will suggest to upgrade your pizza to roman base pizza for 2.5 euro it will be more delicious and crunchy üòã ‚Ä¶"
"The Pantry",343,"laura Healy",1468,"a week ago",1,"To put it simple, horrible! Couldn't enjoy my food as there was a hair in my wrap, flys near my seat and the first place I sat smelled like urine. I ended up moving seats but it really put me off the food when I got it. Prices are extortionate for what you get which is a shame because it looked like a decent place for a quick bite to eat. Would not be recommending to others."
"Milano",254,"Andreia Santos Garcia (Andr√©ia Garcia)",197,"2 years ago",1,"I can consider it to be the worst gastronomic experience I have had here in Cork so far. I ordered a chicken fillet that was the size of my little finger, and a portion of salad equally shameful in presentation and quantity. It looked like I had left the rest of another customer's dish, it was so ugly and disorganized, it wouldn't even be worth 5 euros, let alone 19.88 euros, which was the amount I paid. I do not recommend. It's throwing money away. If delivery is like this, I won't go anywhere near the restaurant's door. Unfortunate. I send photos, the lemon looked like it had been sucked, how disgusting. I didn't eat anything, I wasted my money."
"Milano",254,"lisa babit",1525,"2 months ago",1,"Very poor and low quality service. The place has a credit as is on a busy street only. The girl who served us was very rude. The beer was hot as a tea. The food was for very low quality, calamari burned, I never seen calamari rings burned on one side before in my life.... The bathroom stinks, even can not be locked for privacy. Never would go back!!"
"Milano",254,"Patrick Farmer",1994,"2 months ago",1,"Never got our food, order cancelled. No compensation provided.

Would give the food 0 if I could because I never got it.
Would give the service 0 if I could because we didn't receive any.
Would give the atmosphere 0 if I could because we didn't get the chance to experience it."
"Milano",254,"lidiane alves cardoso",1512,"a month ago",1,"I visited Milano on Oliver Plunkett and had an extremely poor experience. I understand that guests should wait to be shown to a table, which I did without any problem. The restaurant was not busy at all ‚Äî in fact, it was quite the opposite.

After being seated and given the menu, I timed exactly 15 minutes waiting for a server to take my order. I even called out to them. The staff were not busy attending to other customers; they were standing a bit further ahead, talking in the back section of the restaurant. I was seated near the entrance.

I raised my hand to call a waiter, and one person said they would come back ‚Äî but never did. In the end, I simply stood up and left. While I have eaten there before and the food was fine, on this occasion I left without ordering.

When I‚Äôm paying for a meal, the minimum I expect is polite and attentive service. I understand if a place is packed and the staff are overwhelmed ‚Äî that‚Äôs perfectly fine. But this was mid-afternoon, around 2 p.m., and the restaurant was empty. To me, the lack of service was unacceptable, and I would not return."
"Milano",254,"Juan Rocha",1310,"a year ago",3,"The place was clean and had a nice family ambiance. Great for taking the kids out, having a date or just having a quick bite by yourself. Unfortunately I may had a bad day because the food was not as good as I expected. The risotto balls were excellent but the pasta needed more sauce and the edges were very crisp. The service was great. Maybe I'll try it again next time I visit the city."
"Milano",254,"Oliver",1938,"Edited 7 years ago",4,"The pizza here does not seem very traditional but that won't stop you from enjoying it.
They had a special offer where you could get a starter with a main for only (if I remember correctly) ~15‚Ç¨ which is great value!
This place seems to serve food all day so if you're hungry at an awkward hour and like Italian give this place a try."
"Meades Bar 126",255,"Nicola Lee",1896,"2 months ago",5,"This is one of my favourite places in Cork. We‚Äôve been frequenting it for years. The service is always amazing, especially when the proprietor is there. A nicer man you couldn‚Äôt hope to meet. He‚Äôs full of knowledge about wine and food and loves the chat about Cork and what‚Äôs going on. The only problem is we never know when to leave and usually end up a tipple over the limit. Love this place. Can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough. Keep up the good work!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

"Meades Bar 126",255,"Hayden Brunson",1025,"Edited 2 months ago",1,"UPDATE *the owner is a complete tool. Instead of handling this like an adult, he made up a lie that we were asked to move (which we weren‚Äôt because I went up to the bar and asked if they had a bigger table or if we could move a chair over and both the women staff told me a chair would be fine) and we were playing cards AND ordering multiple rounds of drinks. Between all of us, we purchased over 8 glasses of wine and never stayed without a drink.* had to lower my stars because of his response and his inability to handle anything with an ounce of respect, kindness, or understanding.

The wine and place is great, but there is a male on the staff who almost ruined our experience. We had two people coming to the bar so we needed a bigger table, and I asked the staff if it was okay if we moved to another table or just brought up another chair to where we were already sitting. He offered a place in the back but it was smaller, so I said we could squeeze in another chair and fit one of them in the bench, and everything seemed fine. Then my friends came and tried to bring a chair and he was beyond rude and said we could only sit in the back. That would have been fine, and maybe it was a miscommunication from the first place, but instead of being kind and explaining what he meant, he handled the situation in the most un-friendly way he could.

The women on the staff were kind and helped a lot, and the wine was amazing. I just wish he would choose kindness instead of aggressively talking to us the way he did."
"Meades Bar 126",255,"Thais Correia Guerrieri",2465,"3 years ago",5,"The best Cork Wine Bar. It is always playing Jazz in the radio, and the Staff are always kind. They have fairly priced wines in a vintage atmosphere. They just open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 6pm to 11h30pm"

"Meades Bar 126",255,"Alan O'Brien",105,"7 months ago",5,"Marked low for food since it isn't a focus of the place and is a simple offering.

This is the wine bar of Cork! Others exist but lack all the charm and character of here!!  The staff are super helpful for those who only know wine as red or white, and the selection is big and evercharging.

A great and comfortable spot and I recommend it as a place worth being in!"
"Sicilian Delights",346,"AJ Nagle",90,"3 months ago",5,"A nice few vegetarian options - would love to see something like chickpeas of meat replacements in some of the veggie dishes
But the tomato pomodoro dish is fantastic, super tasty
It gets incredibly busy around lunch time - lines out the door, that will show you how good the food is"
"Caf√© Velo",5,"Liamy Mackey",1511,"8 months ago",2,"Food way overpriced and eggs almost a little undercooked. For the price of a veg breakfast you'd expect to be full to the gills leaving the place. Instead was served tiny jars of Beans and avocado to fill up the plate. It should be way cheaper if there is no actual fake meat on the plate. In comparison to the reg (fry) there's a world of difference."
"Kelly's Restaurant",256,"Mark Auchincloss",1647,"2 months ago",5,"Excellent value for money set price 4-course lunch for ‚Ç¨24 per person.  You can just order a main course for ‚Ç¨16.

The starter was a tasty, home-made vegetable soup. I choose the roast turkey & ham with mashed potatoes & boiled vegetables for the main course in a nice gravy & I really enjoyed it. The desert was a hot, rice pudding served with raspberry sauce & cream. That was delicious too. The final course was between a coffee or tea. We ordered a pot of hot water & milk as we brought our own decaffeinated tea. They do not serve alcohol but instead you get a jug of free tap water.

The service was excellent & the waitresses are very patient & helpful in explaining what is available, The blackboards with all lunch courses are prominently displayed at both the grould floor & first floor entrances.

The restaurant is easy to find on the main shopping street just around the corner from the English Market in the centre of Cork."

"Dulce Bun House",257,"J Cronin",1108,"4 months ago",5,"This is one of the most perfect cafes I've ever visited. It's exceptionally clean while being very elegant and charming with comfortable seating. The staff were friendly and the service impeccable. There's a lovely peaceful vibe to enjoy along with the most perfect cappuccino I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. They also offer a small free cream bun with the coffee which is a lovely touch. I could genuinely spend hours here just relaxing.
The only criticism is it's a little on the small side and on wet days can be very crowded or unaccessible which is also a compliment as it's so popular.
I can't recommend this place enough!!!!"

"Jim Cashmans",258,"Mike Mc Mahon",1796,"7 years ago",3,"I might only be giving this pub 3 stars, but it is probably worth a little more than that. I called in twice while I was in Cork, mainly because the outside gives the impression of a proper old style pub, and it doesn't deceive! It is great to see this style of pub still in existence so close to a large city centre. It is very basic inside, but comfortable, and has a number of TV's for watching sport etc.
I had a few pints of Murphy's which were delicious, but there was also a reasonable selection of other drinks. Toilets were spotless, as was the place in general. The only thing it was missing, was an atmosphere. Maybe it was coincidental that when I called, there were only 2 or 3 people in it, and even at that, there was no conversations going on.
From an asthetic perspective, it has a lot going for iteself, but it needs to build its atmosphere. I hope to be in Cork again soon, and will call in maybe on a weekend night, and can review again if it is different."

Very nice ambience where the delicious food was outdone only by the  welcoming service."
"Clancy's Cork",259,"Alice Leonard",143,"5 months ago",5,"Clancy‚Äôs is in the heart of Cork city and upon entering we were immediately welcomed warmly and offered our choice of seating as it was quiet at that point. The servers were attentive, friendly and had a joke with us and some fellow diners also had a joke about the window between our booths, but it was a place set up to have a nice relaxed atmosphere. The fish and chips were excellent, fish flaky and cooked to perfection and the chips accompanying it perfectly. They also told us about a battle of the bands that was going on a little later and although we didn‚Äôt stick around it looked fun."

I do not really like coffee but ordered one anyway because I was watching the game and felt i should buy something. 3/4 of the way through the game I was told that if I did not order something, I had to leave. I explained that I had ordered a coffee, I was told that wages needed to be paid and I should order food or leave the premises. With customer service like that I can see why the place was completely empty. This is the first review I have ever left for any establishment."
"Clancy's Cork",259,"Daniel Bargiel",613,"a year ago",3,"Good sized pub. We had the fish and chips and they were not very good. Flavorless and a bit greasy. The chips were decent. The service was slow, although the servers were always on the move as it seemed they were understaffed at the time."

"Clancy's Cork",259,"Seamus Kearney",2278,"3 years ago",2,"Could be better. Went for Brunch on a Bank Holiday Monday. Nice to be able to sit outside. Limited menu for brunch breakfast options, no sweet choices like pancakes or waffles. Had a full Irish. The sausages were poorly cooked. Could have done with beans or tomato, it was a bit dry without. The puddings & mushroom were nice though. The waiting staff disappeared before we could ask for ketchup, eventually flagged someone but a quality check would have been appreciated.  Service overall wasn't great.
Our bill was not correct too, it included Americanos at ‚Ç¨2.50 each which should have been included in the Full Irish. They rectified, so make sure to double check before you pay.
I'd like to try again for lunch/dinner but won't be in a rush to go soon."

The food was lovely, it didn't take too long to arrive either.
I did feel a bit pestered by the staff that kept asking if I would like a drink yet, other than that the staff were lovely and very friendly.
Bathrooms could use feminine hygiene products.
Lovely experience."
"Jacobs on the Mall",261,"Heriberto Rios",1048,"6 months ago",5,"All 3 course were great. I had a really good cream of mushroom soup for appetizer, chicken breast stuffed with sausage tasty and tender and a flourless chocolate fudge cake that was delightful. They have a great selection of wines and spirits too. I really love it there. Highly recommended."
"Jacobs on the Mall",261,"PH",2038,"Edited 9 months ago",5,"Food is delicious! I got the soup of the day, which happened to be a lovely carrot and turnip with cream. It had great consistency and the cream perfectly contrasted with the textured topping. The pan fried hake is always my go to, and it has never disappointed. Today, it was served with a tangy chickpea salad which paired beautifully with the milder and less overpowering flesh of the hake. Topped with a spinach and lime sauce, this was phenomenal.
For dessert, I recommend the affogato. The expresso with vanilla ice cream is a great way to freshen up, especially after a heavy meal.

Only lost points are for not offering tap water unless specifically requested. You will be charged an extra five euro for water otherwise, which seems a bit deceptive.

Nevertheless, staff are always very accommodating and friendly. The starter bread itself is also one of my favourites on its own and is baked on site.

Would definitely recommend!

Edit: raised my rating to 5 stars as Jacobs really does stand out from everywhere else I've dined at in the last weeks!"
"Jacobs on the Mall",261,"Daisy F. (Daisy F.)",594,"3 weeks ago",5,"Beautiful space, loads of light through many skylights.
Excellent service, friendly and discreet.
There were 3 of us dining.
We opted for the early dinner 40 euro 3 courses.

Good options for most diners, I had the curry potatoes, the ragu with rigatoni, and finished with the Eton mess.
If we eat with our eyes, mine were very impressed.
My 2 companions also enjoyed their meals and appetites sated.

Highly recommend."

"C√∫ Coffee",262,"Adrian Cronin",55,"7 months ago",5,"This outdoor cafe is an old water tower for the long closed Cork to Carrigaline railway line. It's at the start or the end of the busiest Greenway in Ireland, affectionately known by locals as ""the line, a paved Greenway from the city to Passage West. It serves great coffee and a variety of baked goods and pastries. It does soup and soda bread, perfect on cold days. There's plenty of outside seating and lovely views across the water. A nearby public toilet adds convenience."
"C√∫ Coffee",262,"Alan O'Brien",105,"10 months ago",5,"Great coffee in a unique location! They don't offer much food outside of treats (recent addition of soup though is a nice touch) but the staff are great and the coffee is delicious. Worth the stop!"
"Barry's of Douglas Restaurant & Bar",263,"PAMC69",1975,"3 days ago",5,"Celebrated my fathers 93rd birthday with small group of 6 for Sunday lunch and we were seated at a lovely table. The whole ambience was lovely. The staff were very professional, attentive and friendly. Everyone was very happy with the selection of starters, mains and desserts on offer and the food itself was really nice. We had one person vegan and they were pleasantly surprised with the options available to them. The presentation and quality of food was very high and everyone finished their plates - always a good sign. The service was topnotch in fairness. Can easily say it is the best meal out we have had in ages as it ticked every box. We will definitely be returning to Barrys of Douglas as our new No.1 choice of venue! Thanks to the staff that served our table and special thanks to Shany for the candle in my Dad's dessert! I can confidently recommend others to go to Barry's as I'm sure they will be equally as pleased as we were. Thanks to all at Barry's and keep up the good work."
"Barry's of Douglas Restaurant & Bar",263,"Rebecca W",2098,"4 days ago",5,"Thank you yet again for amazing service and tasty food with a wonderful welcome! We booked for 9 and asked to move tables, there was a bit of confusion with numbers and tables but everything was handled with grace and patience. We cannot thank the team enough for looking after us so well!
Every dish was delicious and the atmosphere with music was lovely."

"Barry's of Douglas Restaurant & Bar",263,"TRUTH EATS LONDON",2545,"a year ago",5,"Stopped by here passing through Douglas. The food was lovely. Very big portions. Varied menu including Sunday roasts.
Deserts were on point. Big group of 12 of us, no errors and didn't have to wait too long. Waitresses were attentive and all staff were polite.
We didn't see available street parking but shopping centre parking is nearby.
Would come back!"
"Barry's of Douglas Restaurant & Bar",263,"Meena Waree",1729,"4 months ago",1,"Order chicken goujons and chips for my daughter.
It's very salty and tough for children. I, as an adult, still feel that it's salty. And this is a children's menu, it's even worse.

I finished eating and waited until they came to collect the plates to order a cake for my daughter. Then we went to the bathroom and came back to sit and wait for a while. The staff were standing and talking at the counter. Sat and watched the staff come to collect. Went to look at the cake to order. The staff still didn't ask. So I didn't wait any longer and asked to pay and go home. Or maybe I'm Asian, so they didn't care. Even though they asked if all the food was okay after serving for a while, they didn't. Even though there were 2 staffs there, including the female manager, they still didn't care as much as they should have. that time, there were only 2-3 tables of customers."
"Barry's of Douglas Restaurant & Bar",263,"Binta Onifade",347,"8 months ago",4,"First of all I want to extend my gratitude to who anonymously paid for our meal, my family and I are very grateful for your kindness and I pray you get it back in thousands fold.

Now, about the restaurant, it was a Saturday evening and it was very busy, although the servers were working efficiently but due to them being so busy we had to call them a couple of times about one of the food they forgot to bring to our table, all the food served was delicious and nicely presented, the size and price also seems reasonable. There were times where my 4 year old autistic son was overwhelmed and started crying out loud, my husband and I tried our best to keep him calm and quiet but being who he is, there wasn‚Äôt much we could have done, I just wished the manager would understand the situation when he came to us but instead he told us to please do something because we were disturbing other customers. Because of this my husband had to take him out of the restaurant even though we weren‚Äôt done and they never came back in.

I hope that other people would understand that it is difficult for parents of special needs kids to take their kids out to this kind of settings without being judged and I won‚Äôt let this discourage me from taking my kids out to eat"

My poor aunt (wheelchair) was feeling poorly and we had to take her home.

"Barry's of Douglas Restaurant & Bar",263,"Reka Zzs",2107,"a year ago",4,"We got seated right away which was great, but for unknown reasons we got seated right next to an other couple eventhough the restaurant was 80% empty.
Servers were really unmotivated, felt like they just want us out of there as soon as possible, got cutlery dropped in my lap, after order was taken, no-one came to check up on us unless plates had to be taken away.
Food was served fast and fresh, it was okay."

"Beantown Cafe",264,"Thomas Thornton",2487,"Edited a year ago",5,"Highly recommend dropping by the Beantown Cafe!
The staff are attentive, helpful and very friendly! The cafe has an American theme throughout with number plates and baseball decor!
They have a fantastic menu with amazing food, so far I've tried the breakfast bap and the toasted special! My partner gets the BLT and its pretty good too! I really recommend the toasted special because it really is something special!
They also have homemade bagels with a variety of flavours to choose from. My partner has gotten the bagels a number of times and tried a few of their varieties and since she is a New Yorker I assume that they must be pretty good but be warned, once they are gone, they are gone!
Now for the coffee, they have a great selection of types with a range of milks to choose from if you have a dietary requirement! I usually get an iced coffee when I pass by!
It's always busy which is a great sign of any business but what I will say is that the wait can be kinda long here. However, in saying that, their cooking and brewing space is small and considering the volume of orders I can appreciate that it may take a little longer. We all have grown accustomed to the mass market chains that serve us almost immediately which in reality is not realistic and for this reason I would still say 5 stars for this business, i really do love the store and the freshly made food that they offer here!
And I hope that you may discover this business too!"
"Beantown Cafe",264,"Ruth M",2198,"2 years ago",5,"First but not last visit hopefully. Great coffee and menu in general. Parked up the road and walked to the venue.
Bustling spot with indoor and covered outdoor seating. Decent range of menu options. Had a cheese and ham croissant which was very tasty.
Lots of 2 seat tables and larger ones too. Cosy inside, with a quirky layout."

Clean and tidy and interesting decor. Enjoyable dining experience."
"Beantown Cafe",264,"Emmet Harte",822,"a year ago",5,"It was my first time here with my wife and son, and we felt so welcomed. We asked for a hot chocolate for my son, and it was brought out in a small cup with marshmallows at a perfect temperature - he couldn't get enough of it.

"Beantown Cafe",264,"BCL ADRIAN",314,"2 years ago",4,"This is a very nice spot to have lunch or breakfast. Although not in the city centre it is a really nice spot to have coffee, breakfast or lunch.

"Beantown Cafe",264,"Rory Kelleher",2176,"4 years ago",5,"Lovely little spot with a fantastic menu. Keep going back, so far tried the breakfast bap, Pastrami Melt and the Reuben.

"The Old Bear",265,"Piotr Chabowski",2061,"5 months ago",1,"There is beer. There is service. The worst is the music in the pub where there is no place to dance. Tragic drum and base. The worst pub in the city, you can't even go to eat or drink beer in peace."

Plus it is located next to the Elizabeth fort the Irish market and of course kissers Lane (reportedly the oldest Lane in Cork) for a great pint a good chat and music, it well worth a visit.
Highly recommend"

Their coffee is simply delicious and very well-made. And their sweets! Oh, their sweets! Just breathtaking!

I got a chocolate fudge slice and it was not too sweet nor too bitter. Just perfect!

Their staff and their service is top notch! Very thoughtful and kind! I asked for some recommendations for which sweet to get and they were very helpful and honest!

Josefina and Faye were simply amazing!

It was huge, easily got 14 good size portions out of it. Ordered the choc raspberry custard cake, it was so yummy and beautifully decorated, including the personalised message in the price.

I rang beforehand to ask about ordering cakes, the lady on the phone was very helpful . There are many options (flavours/sizes) . I got a large tray bake celebration cake. For 40 people. My only disappointment was it was devoured so quickly, we never got a proper photograph. We had the Biscoff and caramel buttercream cake. Delicious! They do a similar type muffin in their shop."
"BiteSize",266,"Cara Clayton",418,"4 months ago",5,"My husband and I stopped in for a quick breakfast before heading to Killarney and had a great experience.

"Bright Side",267,"DAMIAN PEPIN",596,"3 weeks ago",5,"Great little spot with very reasonable prices. I ordered the Eggs on Toast.

"Bright Side",267,"gwillym dewick",1000,"6 months ago",5,"Welcoming staff. I only ordered an americano as I was on my way to visit someone in the nearby hospital, and I was a little early. Both staff members bore lovely smiles and extremely courteous.  After paying, I was told to find a seat, and the americano was delivered very quickly to my table. There were a number of young  people seated around and talking quietly to each other at their respective tables. I noted that rolls and sandwiches had  been served to several of them. The atmosphere was nice and quiet, and the welcoming warmth of the staff made this a pleasant visit. I did call in again and was met with the same warmth, although the  customers were definitely medical students. I noted that some were using their laptops to presumably study. I would certainly use these premises again if I am in the area"
"Bright Side",267,"BCL ADRIAN",314,"2 years ago",5,"This is a very nice place to eat breakfast or lunch. Located right in the city centre it has plenty of options to choose from.

"Bright Side",267,"Dante M. Kunc",629,"7 months ago",5,"Best coffee in Cork city! When my parents came to visit, I took them to Brightside, and they were blown away by the quality of the coffee.

"Caf√© Velo",5,"Elk Hunter",795,"8 months ago",5,"Very nice breakfast had here. Poached eggs and sourdough toast was a good value and perfectly cooked. Enough butter was provided for two people.

"Le Chateau",268,"Vincent Wells",2582,"3 months ago",1,"Hit this place just at the right time ‚è≤Ô∏è as it had just opened in the afternoon and we were the second persons to go in.

It didn't take long for the outside seating area to full up because everyone had the same idea as us. Very well staffed beautiful pub inside, plenty of history and a good selection of beers üçª and wine üç∑ üëå. Excellent pint of Guinness."
"Le Chateau",268,"John Mee",1263,"2 months ago",4,"I was in this place twice and it was a very enjoyable experience. Sit outside and enjoy the people watching - there's plenty to see. They serve a small carafe of red wine that is equal to about a glass and a half. Maybe that accounts for the slightly more expensive price. But best of all, the staff are very friendly - just what you'd expect from those that live in the true capital of Ireland. We didn't have the food so can't comment on that. 5* all round."
"Le Chateau",268,"Liz Hudson",1534,"4 months ago",5,"Stopped into La Chateau and instantly fell in love with the vibe. It‚Äôs got that old world charm and character you‚Äôd expect from one of the oldest pubs in Cork. So much history in the walls, but still super lively and welcoming.

Really tasty."
"The Black Dog",269,"Adele",48,"3 months ago",4,"We ordered the pork tacos and beef birra Tacos which were delicious. Their home made sauce is really tasty. I had a Mexican mule cocktail which I really enjoyed.  The portion  size was  generous.

"The Black Dog",269,"Luke Ratterman",1580,"3 years ago",5,"Wow! The best authentic Mexican food I have had. The slow cooked birria beef tacos dunked in the sauce made my mouth water constantly.

Had my dinner there tonight so‚Ä¶upon entering I was accommodated at a table that was reserved; yes I was informed it was reserve for 2 hrs later. Fair as I was alone so it wasn‚Äôt an issue.
The staff were exceptional! So kind and considerate. My meal came  SO fast & thank goodness for that because I was starving.

My salad was fresh and tasty! Nice chunks of avocado too.

My chicken supreme was SO SO GOOD! I normally don‚Äôt eat cauliflower so I gave it a taste tonight and ended up eating it. That goes to show on how well prepared everything was right down to the cauliflower.

"GLOBE Restaurant and Bar",270,"Michal Wojtowicz",1770,"6 months ago",5,"Very good food, i noticed many bad reviews mostly about the price being too high, if people complain about it being too much they should go to the local chippers. Very good service and interior."
"Sam‚Äôs Coffee",273,"Mike",1789,"a year ago",5,"Always love going to Sam's for a coffee. Great atmosphere and the lads are always friendly and in good form. Nice and cosy inside and there's a drive thru too if you don't fancy leaving the car! Coffee is always really good and some nice treats."
"GLOBE Restaurant and Bar",270,"Robert Mills",2146,"a year ago",1,"Avoid at all costs ridiculously overpriced food that is clearly frozen and very unprofessional staff which I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs their fault I think it‚Äôs lack of training. I had the worst fish and chips I have ever had. There was so much grease on the fish it was dripping out of it and onto the chips that it set on you could literally squeeze the grease out of the chip that came from the fish they were that saturated in grease absolutely disgusting when I complained about it nothing was done. What really made this whole experience even worse was when I was finished and we paid our bill we sat in the seating area of the lobby to finish our drinks and as we were heading back up to our room we were stopped by a staff member and asked to come back in to pay for our meal that we just paid for which of course technically is a false arrest."
"GLOBE Restaurant and Bar",270,"Karina Berariu",1354,"5 months ago",2,"I was staying at the hotel for work and came to the restaurant hoping for a quick dinner before a busy evening. Unfortunately, the experience left a lot to be desired. There was no one to greet me when I arrived, and I stood waiting for about five minutes before another guest kindly informed me I should just seat myself. I wasn‚Äôt given a menu and had to go to the bar to ask for one.

Service was very slow ‚Äî it took a while for anyone to take my drink and food order. I ordered the pork belly and waited around 45 minutes before checking in, only to be told there had been delays due to a fire drill earlier that affected the gas supply. This hadn‚Äôt been mentioned when I ordered.

When the food arrived (after about an hour), it was just okay. The pork belly was unfortunately overcooked and quite dry. I had originally planned to stay for dessert, but decided it wasn‚Äôt worth the extra time.

If you‚Äôre staying here and hoping for a smooth, timely meal, I‚Äôd recommend looking elsewhere."
"GLOBE Restaurant and Bar",270,"Kevin McCabe",1426,"2 years ago",3,"Though the service was friendly, it was sparse and you had to wait a long time to get a drink or your order taken. Pints were overpriced. It is a posh comfortable environment, but it felt like everyone there was on business or holiday. There was nothing really wrong with it, this just isn‚Äôt my favorite type of Irish spot. Can‚Äôt say I was very impressed. If you‚Äôre staying in the hotel and just want something easy and convenient, go for it. If wanting to explore Cork, there are many other good spots for a pint and/or a good bite."
"GLOBE Restaurant and Bar",270,"Anacatalina",186,"a year ago",1,"The staff is really friendly and try to do their best, however food is absolutely horrendous.
Worst curry I‚Äôve ever had."
"GLOBE Restaurant and Bar",270,"Abbie Fagan",27,"2 years ago",1,"The service in this restaurant tonight was appalling. At entrance, no one was there to seat us so we had to find our own seats. We waited around 15 minutes to even receive menus, even that we had to call a second waitress over to get them as the first one we called over never ended up giving them to us even though she said she would. The food was acceptable, but the service did not create a pleasant or enjoyable atmosphere. We later received our food and waited an extra 10 minutes whilst eating to receive our drinks. I also received the worst pint of coors I have ever seen in my entire life, the head on the pint was paper thin and the pint overall tasted funny. The bartender agreed with me that the pint did not look right but didn‚Äôt offer me a new one just topped up the head on the same pint instead. When we finished our meal, I stood up as no one was coming to us to offer us a dessert menu and walked to the entrance where there was a waitress. I asked her for the dessert menu and she then begged me to sit down and said she would bring one to me. At the end of the night the waitress handed me the bill and asked me to please check the bill? I have never been asked this before, as expected the bill was wrong and I was being charged for items I did not order. She then reprinted the bill and asked me to check it once again. When I confronted one of the staff for the unacceptable waiting time she told me to ‚Äúmaybe book tomorrow instead‚Äù. This was not a great experience and I am very disappointed in the restaurant and its staff as the restaurant was not busy at all and I would not be recommending this restaurant to anyone I know."
"Caf√© Velo",5,"Dr. J. Nali",747,"2 years ago",5,"The staff were very respectful and nice in the morning for breakfast.

Was not greeted at entrance after 5 mins then asked for a table. It was not busy.  Would expect regular check ins by servers especially after having a finished  plate for 20 mins to ask if anything else needed or the bill. Finally approached cashier on my own and paid and left without staying for dessert or another drink."

Vegan burguer was huge! The chicken curry was delicious and came with a huge side of rice and an Indian bread. The carvery portions were amazing and the gravy was delicious!
Desserts were nice as well!
The floor staff didn‚Äôt gave us the drink menu, but there was a huge variety of drinks as well, you can see many alcoholic beverage streamers at the bar, and they have bottles as well.
We will be back soon."

The ambiance was perfect‚Äîrelaxed yet stylish, making it a great spot for both a casual night out or a special occasion. The food was absolutely delicious, with a great variety of dishes that were beautifully prepared and full of flavor.

What truly made the evening exceptional, though, was the service. Our waiter, Tomi, was outstanding. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. His attention to detail and genuine hospitality made a lasting impression.

Highly recommend this place if you're looking for great food, a welcoming atmosphere, and top-notch service. Be sure to ask for Tomi‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be disappointed!"

On top of that, her service was top-notch: attentive, professional, and full of positive energy. Latoya truly made the experience memorable.

My spouse's ""Guacamole"" tasted and had the texture of green mayo instead of anything made of avocado. No complaints about the service, my exclusive problem was with food."

It‚Äôs rare to find someone who goes above and beyond to ensure every guest has an excellent experience, but that‚Äôs exactly what he did.

The cafe also boasts an impressive array of treats and pastries, each one more tempting than the last.

Food was amazing especially the pasta dishes we ordered.  Would 100% recommend to anyone looking for a great Italian meal out in Cork."
"Il Padrino Restaurant",275,"Arash",269,"a month ago",4,"I visited Il Padrino for dinner as a group of four people.

I would recommend reserving a table. The restaurant fills up with diners very quickly after 6pm.

There is a great variety of dishes to choose from. We ordered Arancini, or deep fried rice balls, and garlic bread for starters. Both were delicious, though we would have welcomed more than two rice balls on the plate.

For the main course, everybody ordered something different: risotto, tagliatelle, chips. We all enjoyed our meals. I had tagliatelle with chicken and mushroom sauce, ""Tagliatelle al Pollo"", which was exceptional and the garlic bread accompanying the dish was nice.

The staff were all friendly and very quick to fulfill our requests for extra water and sharing plates.

One nice improvement to the menu would be the addition of photos of most or all dishes on the menu. It makes it easier for people unfamiliar with Italian dishes to understand what is on offer.

I would recommend Il Padrino to anyone looking to eat out at an Italian restaurant in the heart of Cork City."
"Il Padrino Restaurant",275,"Eoghan O‚ÄôConnor",831,"a year ago",5,"Second time here to this authentic Italian restaurant and it was just as delicious as the first! Everything on the menu that we have tried has been top notch and plentiful.

The only negative I have is the price of minerals at ‚Ç¨3.90 each.

Don‚Äôt let this put you off though. The homely atmosphere makes you feel as though you are in the heart of Italy.

Service was swift and attentive. We will be back no doubt! üáÆüáπ

Don‚Äôt let this put you off however. The service was swift and attentive."
"Il Padrino Restaurant",275,"Shridhyey Gupta",2329,"4 months ago",4,"I ordered a vegetarian pizza and a hot chocolate.

The vegetarian pizza didn‚Äôt feel like a true, authentic pizza. It was heavily loaded with mozzarella cheese, which completely overpowered the other flavors. While there was a reasonable amount of vegetables, the combination didn‚Äôt come together well. The overall taste was dominated by the excessive cheese, making the dish feel unbalanced and quite heavy.

The hot chocolate was also disappointing. It is advertised as an ‚ÄúItalian chocolate,‚Äù but the flavor resembled something closer to a basic dairy milk hot chocolate. It lacked the richness, texture, and depth typically associated with Italian-style hot chocolate.

Overall, while the presentation was decent, the taste and authenticity of both dishes left much to be desired."
"The Coffee Hut",288,"Brian Maher",378,"a year ago",5,"Top place for a coffee"
"Il Padrino Restaurant",275,"Kevin Byrne",1413,"Edited 2 months ago",4,"I love this restaurant and have been going here on and  off here for probably 15 years.  Anything I say here is in the context of me liking the restaurant and is meant in a constructive way. The best thing about this place is undoubtedly the staff. They're always friendly and kind, particularly when there are kids involved. I ordered a pizza margherita. The base wasn't ""right"". It didn't have the elasticity and lightness found in a good base. The base reminded me of a sort of crusty bread in texture. Previous pizzas in Il Padrino haven't always been like this, although the last few times they have been. The tomato sauce wasn't pletniful on the pizza and didn't have any tang or basil flavour. The pizza was laden with a salty mozzarella and cheddar. The experience at the restaurant was lovely.  The atmosphere was lovely. The lighting and setting also really pleasing.  I'll always turn here as I've always liked these factors but please give us the pizzas like ye used to make - light, full of flavour, and not too cheesy. I hope ye don't mind the feedback."
"Il Padrino Restaurant",275,"K 99",1330,"4 months ago",4,"The food is enjoyable, I love the risotto here! It‚Äôs always been very busy when I‚Äôve visited but the staff deal with it well and around tables impressively quickly! Have always had friendly and pleasant service too. It is a bit crowded in there with tables being quite close to each other,  but in a way it does add to the character of the place. If you‚Äôre in Cork and like Italian food, it‚Äôs definitely a great place to try. One of my favourite Italian restaurants in Cork."

"Il Padrino Restaurant",275,"Ieva Loca",1072,"5 months ago",5,"The carbonara is to die for. I'm not kidding. It's the best Carbonara I've ever had, and I've had a few. Pizza was really good, too, and Tiramisu was just amazing. Service is exceptional. We were seated right at the pass where the food came out of the kitchen, and it was so nice to see the whole process (I watched my Carbonara being made and plated just for me). Wine was delicious. The only beer they have is Peroni, but sure, that's not the end of the world. Loved everything about it, the atmosphere, food, service, all 10 out of 10."
"Scoozi",276,"Amanda O' Sullivan",163,"3 months ago",5,"Writing this review is making me want to book a table all over again ‚Äî the food was outstanding!
The classic lasagne was honestly one of the most delicious I‚Äôve ever had in my life ‚Äî rich, hearty, and perfectly balanced.
My now-husband had the pasta, which was cooked to perfection. The sauce was a rich tomato with just the right kick of spice.
The pizza had that perfect crispy edge ‚Äî not too thick, not too thin.

But the star of the show? The Toblerone cheesecake.
As a huge cheesecake fan, I can honestly say I did not want to share. It was creamy, fluffy, and the buttery base crumbled beautifully under the fork.

A truly enjoyable experience ‚Äî the perfect fun date night.
Highly recommended.

"Scoozi",276,"Jay Patel",1177,"7 months ago",5,"We ate at this place this evening. The manager who greeted us advised there was no table available (6pm Saturday evening) but if we were happy to wait 15 minutes we could be accommodated. We happily waited and were seated within 15 minutes.
The entire staff were amongst the most attentive I‚Äôve ever come across and appear genuinely happy to be there. The decor is very cosy and quaint. The food was spectacular. You can taste the quality and level of freshness of the ingredients. You really can see why this place won awards for the best food in cork in 2021 and again in 2025. You can see why people are willing to wait for this establishment. We even bumped into a local as we were lost the evening before nowhere near the place and he actually recommended this place. It was only once we were seated inside that I remembered this. Not just recommended by tourists but by locals as well. Just shows how well regarded this establishment is!!! Well done guys and keep up the good work!"

"Scoozi",276,"√Å Dal",9,"Edited 4 weeks ago",1,"We came here looking for authentic Italian food and unfortunately left very disappointed.

When I asked if the pasta was fresh, our server didn‚Äôt even seem to know what fresh pasta was‚ÄîI had to explain it. We started with the Greek tartlet, but the base was raw at the bottom. The pizzas were no better: the dough wasn‚Äôt remotely close to authentic, and the Margherita came with a lot of balsamic drizzled on top, which was just strange.

We also ordered loaded fries and were told they were frozen‚Äîhonestly, they tasted it too. Overall, the food was poor quality, nowhere near Italian standards, and yet wildly overpriced for what‚Äôs being served.

This place feels over-rated and in no way represents proper Italian cooking. Hard pass from me."
"Scoozi",276,"Gniddew Liame",980,"8 months ago",4,"Scoozi is a family favourite and for a reason.
It's a staple within the Cork food scene.
It serves Italian food with an Irish twist, it's simple yet tasty.
It's nice to see familiar faces within the place, their ma√Ætre d' has been around for a while.
He's always very friendly and welcoming.

Due to the demand, bookings are hard to come by and the queues can get very long.
Tried to use their booking system and emailed to confirm, but did not hear anything from the restaurant.
Better off ringing the restaurant to confirm/make bookings.
Prices are in line with inflation and prices around Cork.
Buffalo wings are covered in a tangy, sweet smokey sauce, very similar to BBQ sauce and were quite tough.
Their desserts have noticeably decreased in size.

Staff are really accommodating and were generally lovely to accommodate a family, especially with a toddler.
Overall, would never turn down a visit to Scoozi but it is harder to get in the door nowadays without a booking üòÖ."

I only had 30 min spare as I had to run for airport so I asked the waiter if its possible to fit me in for 30 min timing as I have to get my order and eat within 30 min to catch earlier ordered taxi for airport. The waiter was kind enough to recommend the amazing burger which was brought to me within 5 min and after eating it I even had some spare time left! Thank you so much for an awesome service.

Out of the three the avocado toast was my favourite."
"GoGo‚Äôs",277,"Julie Smyth",1323,"2 months ago",1,"Overpriced ( its everywhere in Ireland but this is jaw dropping), overcooked ( burnt bacon on the Eggs Benedict which could have been forgiven except next table also complained) and very slow service in that not all parties received their food at the same time. Wont be returning."
"GoGo‚Äôs",277,"Ruth M",2198,"2 years ago",5,"First time here. We were seated when we arrived, they very obligingly pushed tables together for us.
Mostly tables for 2 set up inside, mostly for 4 outside I think. Not huge inside, there's an area to purchase to take-away items also.
It was busy at lunchtime.
Lovely brunch selection. They were knowledgeable and helpful when it came to choices. Allergens were well labelled.
Portions were large e.g. the salads accompanying the Frittata and Mediterranean Fritters. Food was delicious. Service wasn't very fast but then it was busy.
Not a lot of parking available. Please be aware of the local school starting and finishing times as traffic became very busy at that time. Try to avoid 1.30 and 2.30 for arriving and leaving! üòÖ"
"GoGo‚Äôs",277,"Erin Lavigne",845,"a year ago",5,"We happened on this great little gem as we came home and we're staying nearby.  The breakfasts are to die for and we picked up a beef lasagna and garlic bread for dinner and it was loved by all.  If you are in the area swing in!!"
"GoGo‚Äôs",277,"Sar",2240,"a year ago",2,"Would not recommend if you have any dietary issues as things are not labelled properly with ingredients and also prices (in the deli part). Got takeaway, told the girl I was vegitarian. Ordered Indian cake and cheese and jalapeno poppers, the girl heated them up and made me coffee. The coffee was nice but the food wasn‚Äôt heated properly when I got it for takeaway. When I bit into the cheese poppers I found ham which wasn‚Äôt labelled in store. I rang to ask to make sure they said no ham in it it‚Äôs jalapeno. I said I can see ham. They checked with kitchen and yes there was ham in it and no it wasn‚Äôt on the label description on the counter. I just informed them that it really should be on the label but the phone call ended abruptly. Not very good customer service no matter how busy a place is!"
"Orso Kitchen & Bar",278,"Ana Maria Merlin",183,"5 months ago",5,"Amazing food, 10/10! Everything was well-prepared, flavorful, and beautifully presented.
The place is small but very cozy ‚Äî everything is new, clean, and well-organized.
Service was also great, with friendly and attentive staff.
Waiting time was totally fine, nothing excessive.
Highly recommend! Definitely worth a visit."
"Orso Kitchen & Bar",278,"Stephanie Francis",2383,"9 months ago",5,"Had one of the best meals of 2024 in Orso last week. Absolutely stunning food, including top class plant-based dishes that would leave you wanting second helpings. Staff were efficient, friendly and so attentive. We were lucky to get the two seats at the counter inside the window vs opposite the door which could be a little chilly of a winter‚Äôs evening. Genuinely can‚Äôt wait to go back."

"Orso Kitchen & Bar",278,"Iris",1084,"4 months ago",5,"Amazing dining experience with a touch of Middle Eastern cuisine. The staff are very friendly and the space is welcoming. Highly recommend trying their house stone baked bread that resembles flat bread. Warm out of the oven, it melts in your mouth. The hummus was also amazing and one of the best we've ever had with real good olive oil on top. The chicken was the best we've ever had, tender, refreshing with the touch of lemon sauce and perfectly matching the crispy layered potato cake and the roasted pumpkin. Overall, an amazing combination. Regarding desserts, if you don't have a sweet tooth, I wouldn't recommend the white chocolate dessert. Instead, I would go for the Middle Eastern milk pudding, very mild, comforting to digest with rhubarb and hibiscus compote that gives it an acid but perfectly balanced touch. Perfectly light to digest the meal. All ingredients are locally sourced. We'll definitely go back whenever we're next in Cork."

"Okura Japanese Cuisine",279,"Pauline Z",2027,"2 weeks ago",2,"Restaurant has nice decor and good atmosphere, but food was severely lacking in flavour and quality.  Chashu ramen noodles were too soft and the soup lacked flavour and depth. Ajiso platter was not worth the price. We asked for water and was told we could not get water due to it being yellow that day and if we wanted to drink something, we would have had to pay for it. And right when we were about to eat, they showed us the yellow water. Is the water not used for all the cooking and washing of dishes? If the restaurant has an issue, it should have been closed that day. We had checked out the reviews beforehand, so confused about this overall very disappointing experience."

"Deep South",281,"Juliana Sampaio",1319,"3 months ago",5,"My recent visit to Deep South Pub was nothing short of exceptional, truly making it a standout choice for any occasion, especially a corporate event.

From the moment we arrived, the atmosphere was incredibly inviting. It struck the perfect balance for networking and relaxed socializing.

The food deserves a special mention. The BBQ  was delicious, well-prepared, and served with attention to detail. It's clear that quality ingredients are a priority here.

The service was impeccable. The staff were attentive, friendly, and efficient, ensuring that every need was met without being intrusive. This level of professionalism is exactly what you look for when planning a corporate gathering.

And the DJ? Absolutely fantastic! The music selection was spot on, creating an energetic and enjoyable vibe that kept spirits high throughout the evening. It added an extra layer of fun without overwhelming conversations.

Overall, Deep South Pub delivered on all fronts: great food, an amazing DJ, top-notch service, and a superb atmosphere. It's an excellent venue for a corporate event, offering everything needed for a memorable and successful gathering. Highly recommended!"

Deep South is one of my favorite spots in Cork. The atmosphere is always buzzing, whether you're there for a relaxed pint or a night out with friends.

"Deep South",281,"Diana Nozdracova",721,"2 months ago",1,"Very disappointing experience at the Beer Garden
My husband and I had a very unpleasant experience with the bar staff at the Beer Garden. It was around 10 PM and the bar was not crowded. My husband raised his hand to get the attention of the bartenders ‚Äî all three of them saw us clearly waiting to place an order. We stood at the bar for 20 minutes, but none of them came to take our order. They were chatting among themselves and completely ignored us.
When I finally approached them to ask why we were being ignored, one of the bartenders responded very rudely, saying he was ""too busy"" unloading clean glasses from the dishwasher. When my husband questioned his priorities ‚Äî whether clean glasses were more important than serving customers ‚Äî the bartender said the glasses were more important.
To make things worse, one of them insulted me by saying he couldn‚Äôt understand me because my English was bad. For the record, I speak English very well.
We were really looking forward to enjoying the atmosphere, but unfortunately, the staff‚Äôs behavior ruined the evening for us. The only positive thing I can say is that the music was great that night.
I sincerely hope the owner of this place takes this feedback seriously and takes appropriate action. I also hope there are security cameras in place so the owner can review the behavior of their staff and judge for themselves. We were there on August 2nd, between 9:00 PM and 10:30 PM.

Thank you."
"Deep South",281,"Mr Walsh",1829,"a year ago",4,"A very spacious pub that has an outdoor area attached to the back of the premises. That can be covered or uncovered to suit the weather. You will get a pint or a coca cola for around ‚Ç¨6 euros. It also has a few bar counters that are in use most of the time and for busy occasions. Food is also served in the deep south and is definitely worth a visit. Very busy staff that are unbelievably quick at serving at busy times. Prices are averagely expensive and in line with other pubs due to high vat and increases in the hospitality sector in Ireland."
"Deep South",281,"Narayan Vyas",1848,"5 months ago",5,"This is the best place in Cork for a group or Office party. It jas open space so in sunny days you can sit outside.

"The Sandwich Stall",282,"Anne Kokke",234,"3 years ago",3,"To my taste, the grilled sandwich I had was average at best. Contrasting to other reviews here I think mine was stuffed only modestly and (therefore) lacking flavour. Bread was more on the dry than fluffy side.

"Luigi Malones Cork",284,"AJ Nagle",90,"5 months ago",5,"I was skeptical going here but all my friends love it so I gave it a go
The reason I was so skeptical is because I'm a vegetarian and Italian places usually don't have many *good* options for me
I was pleasantly surprised to see tofu and chickpea fajitas on the menu and I was excited but a lil hesitant
But
They were AMAZING!!! I mean, these fajitas are 10 times better than the veggie fajitas I've gotten in Mexican places in Cork
And my passion fruit cocktail was lovely too"

"Luigi Malones Cork",284,"Harvey Johnson",1022,"4 months ago",1,"Despite Luigi Malones‚Äô generally positive reviews, my experience tonight was nothing short of terrible. I ordered the cheeseburger with bacon, and it was honestly the worst burger I‚Äôve ever had. It was clearly, unmistakably frozen‚Äîlike something you‚Äôd find for 50 cent in Aldi‚Äôs freezer. I eat half of it out of pure hunger before getting sick in the bathroom. It‚Äôs obvious this place has gone drastically downhill and is now serving up low-grade, frozen food while cutting corners at every opportunity. See the attached photo of the ‚Äúburger meat.‚Äù"
"Luigi Malones Cork",284,"Gabbie J",913,"4 months ago",5,"Always have an amazing time whenever I visit Luigi Malones. The food is so tasty and the portion sizes are great!

"Luigi Malones Cork",284,"valdez3080",2558,"3 weeks ago",3,"Very busy at dinner hour.  Although space was available.  After being seated it seemed like 15 minutes before we were contacted by our server.  She was less than joyful.  We saw her about another 15 minutes later to order.  Food took a while to arrive also.  It appeared that other servers were more attentive.  The food that arrived was OK, not spectacular.  Upon finishing our meal we sat waiting for our server to either check on us or bring the bill.  She was busy cleaning tables, sweeping and didn't avert her attention towards us, as I was waiting to hail her.  We walked up to the cashier and paid the bill.

"Cafe Mexicana",285,"Kermit Jones",1407,"4 months ago",3,"My family and I were traveling through and hoping for a little hit of authentic Mexican flavor. With a motto like ‚Äúa taste of Mexico‚Äù and ‚Äúauthentic Mexican cuisine,‚Äù I was optimistic. After all, I‚Äôve lived everywhere from the East Coast to the West Coast of the U.S., spent a few years in Texas (for context, not a fan of Tex-Mex), and even crossed the border into Mexico a few times‚Äîso I was ready for something familiar.

Unfortunately‚Ä¶ this wasn‚Äôt it. I‚Äôm honestly not sure what part of Mexico this food claims to represent, because the flavors didn‚Äôt match anything I‚Äôve had. It tasted a bit more like if an Italian and a Mexican got married, raided the pantry, and stirred spaghetti sauce into the beans. My daughter, ever the food philosopher, argued it was actually Indian fusion. Either way, it wasn‚Äôt quite the experience we‚Äôd hoped for. Maybe we should have stuck to the little taqueria we saw down the street.

On top of that, the service left us feeling a bit invisible. We don‚Äôt drink much, so after we were seated and our food arrived, we basically didn‚Äôt see anyone again for about half an hour‚Äîno water refills, no ‚Äúis everything okay?‚Äù Meanwhile, other tables around us were getting checked on regularly. And hey, we‚Äôre a fun family! We would‚Äôve happily chatted.

Oh, and the glassware‚Ä¶ yikes. One of the glasses had stuff stuck to both the outside and inside. When I asked the waiter for a clean one, he just walked over and swapped it from another table. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel bad for whoever got stuck with that trade.

All in all, Caf√© Mexicana has a cool vibe, and maybe it hits the spot for some. But for us, it was a bit of a letdown. Here‚Äôs hoping the next stop on our travels serves up a little more of the authentic flavor we‚Äôre craving."
"Cafe Mexicana",285,"k√ºbra Keles",1456,"a month ago",3,"We were surprised by the good reviews, as our own experience was disappointing. The staff and atmosphere were nice, but everything we ordered (nachos & tacos) was covered in tomato sauce and lacked balance, leaving only a tomato aftertaste on the palate. Having tried Mexican food in different places (including Mexico City), this was not what we expected."

"Cafe Mexicana",285,"Marty Butler",1680,"a month ago",4,"Went here for my GFs birthday it was really good. Let me start by saying we sat right at the door when you walk in downstairs , good seats, but the woman serving was on her own. It took 45 mins from when we walked in to the restaurant  until when we get our food. The only complaint about the food is the Chimichanga was a little bit cold in the middle but it was still super tasty! The Dynamite nachos were very spicy. Ribs were superb, chicken wings were a bit crispy but still very good"
"The Laurel Bar",6,"James Muir",1150,"5 months ago",5,"Lovely little boozer for sports and pool. Inclusive landlord and  locals give the place a really great atmosphere.

Finally, I would like to mention that we were served by a beautiful, kind and warm woman named Alba who with her charisma brought us several smiles and made the evening even better ü´∞üèª"
"Old Reliable Irish Pub",286,"Amber Block",169,"5 months ago",5,"I had a great time at Old Reliable Irish Pub! I picked it off Google just wanting a quick pint, and I am so glad I did.

Thanks for the great experience and conversation! - Missouri, USA near Springfield"
"Old Reliable Irish Pub",286,"Jody Ricottone",1241,"7 months ago",2,"The bartender was very nice and made a great suggestion for an alternative when they were out of what we ordered. The place has a distinctly smoky smell, when mixed with the musty scent it was not the most pleasant place to enjoy a pint. The ladies‚Äô restroom was down a long and dark corridor. We were there in the afternoon, so can‚Äôt speak to the atmosphere in the evening. A few gambling machines inside. Quite a few locals having a pint. Not my favorite, but might be great for someone looking for a local dive bar."

With a great relaxed vibe (each spot candlelit), plenty of beers on tap, including an alternative to Guinness (Beamish Irish stout) this is a great place to come and chat.

She either forgot or didn't want to take my order and never took my order after waiting another 45 minutes. I have a background in the service industry and this is a really bad way to treat a customer. If you want really bad service and leave hungry, this place is your best bet."

Entered to ask about food and was invited to go up the block and get take away and bring it in. Grabbed a surprisingly yummy pizza and spicy potatoes and headed back to a crowded bar invitingly lit by candles in whiskey bottles and cheery lights throughout the three-roomed pub. Found a spot and felt welcomed by the obvious tourist like us, college students, local elderly men all enjoying each other's company while the tunes played Motown hits, 80s English new wave and 70s punk. This place had all the vibes. Tried my first Beamish here, loved this strong stout. and my husband had a faithful Guinness."

Steadily my list of favourite pubs in Cork is growning and The Abby Tavern certainly makes it onto my little list!
We called in around 7pm on a Saturday in Octpber and it was lovely and quiet! They were a couple of tables available and we were delighted to be able to sit down and take in the atmosphere.
The staff were very friendly and very quick service and they keep the premises spotless.
The staff had two open fires lit which really added to the romantic atmosphere and had the premises lovely and cosey!
They had a beautiful pint of Guinness and a lovely hot Whiskey with a slice of lemon and cloves! I finally split the infamous G on the Guiness however I did not take a picture so I guess it never happened hahaüôÉ
From what we could see you can order a pizza from the neighbours from ""Oak Fire Pizza"" which is really nice!
The bar is decorated with some interesting wall art and its worth a walk around to see it all!
The Abby Tavern is truely a hidden gem in the south side of Cork City which I think makes it really great! The crowd is nice and unlike some more modern bars there was no television! Just really great conversations happen all around which is a really Irish thing and I'm glad to see it alive and well!
Definitely stop by and have a few sociables and you won't be dissapointed!"
"The Abbey Tavern",290,"Rory O'Callaghan",2178,"2 years ago",5,"Had an amazing evening with friends and strangers i got to know. Bar staff were great  customers were kind and the music was top notch.

"Malay Kitchen Cork City",291,"Declan Cael",687,"4 months ago",4,"Tucked away in Cork City, Malay Kitchen delivers bold, authentic flavours with a warm welcome to match. The Nasi and Mee Goreng were standouts ‚Äî rich in spice, cooked to order, and packed with that unmistakable wok hei. Portions were generous, and prices felt more than reasonable for the quality. Service was a real highlight: friendly, attentive, and genuinely inviting.

Just a heads-up for dine-in ‚Äî seating is minimal, with bar-style stools and space for only six, so it‚Äôs more of a quick bite than a long sit-down. The only slight letdown was the Mee Goreng sauce, which was a bit heavy and made the noodles softer than expected. Still, a great spot that punches well above its size, and we‚Äôll definitely be back to explore more of the menu."

Got the pad Thai and garlic & fried rice for lunch and it was delightful. Gutted that they no longer offer their Khao Pad but delighted to still see Malay Kitchen in Cork city. Do miss their lunch specials which was rampant around Cork before, understandable given the cost of living crisis but visit was bittersweet.

Dining/sit down area is smaller (bar seating) and they don't have 'free water' station anymore.
Great if you're into spicy food.
Staff was lovely and thorough, hard to understand sometimes but it's all good. Would visit again if we find ourselves in the city and if they're open."

- Coxinha (chicken croquettes) are not good at all, I don't recommend, you doesn't taste any chicken.
- Pork belly is okay but nothing impressive about it."

Whenever I have friends going to Cork, will recommend this place to them!"
"Market Lane",294,"Pasquale Cerone",1982,"5 months ago",5,"A lovely and well-kept place, right in the heart of Cork on Oliver Plunkett Street.
The staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming. The food is truly authentic Irish cuisine, with outstanding quality.

I highly recommend the onion soup, topped with a traditional cheese from County Cork ‚Äì pure comfort food!
The homemade desserts are excellent, and there‚Äôs a great selection of craft beers.
As expected in Ireland, tap water is served for free.

What can I say? A great experience ‚Äì highly recommended!"

"Market Lane",294,"Melanie Tam",1736,"a month ago",4,"Market Lane was by our hotel and the menu looked good, so we decided to check it out one night for dinner. It was a Tuesday, just after 7 and it was packed inside. Luckily, there was an outside table for the three of us, and they were able to accommodate a stroller.

For drinks, I was looking forward to a Guinness, but they didn't have. So instead, I had the Angel stout, which was very smooth. It was a bit darker and a little more bitter than Guinness, but still good. For food, we had:

-Chicken liver p√¢t√©, spiced plum chutney with sourdough toast - not sure if I really loved this one but the sourdough toast was good
Glenbeigh mussels steamed in white wine, cream, celery and herbs with crusty baguette  - I don't normally like anything with celery but I didn't taste it here, so it was fine. I liked the mussels. This kind was small, which I prefer to the giant ones found in the U.S.
-Pan roast Ballycotton monkfish, garlic ratte potatoes, roast pepper pur√©e, lemon salted green beans, smoked pancetta and almond crumb - the fish was cooked perfectly and tasted fresh, but the green beans could have used a bit more cooking time
-Sirloin Steak (10oz) - my husband got this one since he wanted to try the beef in Ireland, and it didn't disappoint. Their steaks are served with mushrooms, house chips, shallots and choice of: peppercorn and brandy cream, whipped garlic butter or roasted pepper chimichurri. He picked the peppercorn and brandy, which was nice

I really liked that they had a kids' menu and that there were no chicken tenders or pizza to be found on there. Instead, there were dishes like shepherd's pie, pasta Bolognese, and roasted chicken breast. They even had a baby bowl, which we ended up ordering for my 8-month old. It was a huge bowl of mashed potatoes, finely shredded chicken, with tiny bits of soft carrots. She loved it! It also came with a side of gravy, but we used that for ourselves. It tasted similar to the peppercorn and brandy cream that came with the steak. I really appreciated this menu item because I never really see baby food on restaurant menus, and this allowed her to be a part of our dining experience."
"Market Lane",294,"Estere B",851,"5 months ago",4,"Really nice experience at this restaurant. The  menu was really appealing and ours starters and mains delicious! My only complaint would be the desert. I ordered the brownie which looked amazing on all the pictures I had seen and had very good reviews.. but unfortunately it was served cold (very slightly heated up in a microwave), with hard crusts.. and the drizzle of ‚Äúsalted caramel‚Äùwas completely artificial and tasted very very sweet. But other than that we had a very good evening."
"Market Lane",294,"Teresa",2458,"2 months ago",5,"Had a lovely spiced Moroccan lamb rump here, the Monkfish was also divine. The service is amazing, all servers were very professional. Second to none, will certainly make a habit of returning here when in Cork.

The chefs are also trained to perfection and you can see them cooking from the table. üëå"
"Market Lane",294,"Jorge Silva",1295,"2 months ago",5,"Tdlr: great place to eat good food. Warning with delays when packed.

Cocktails: were great, tasted very good. We had mango loco and bohemian raspberry.

Starters: calamari and the duck. Calamari was simply amazing, the duck was tasty but portion was kinda lacking. Crispy skin would have been a plus.

Mains: we had the fish curry (not in the menu) and monkfish. All flavours were amazing and perfect. Mains took about 40 min to arrive. House was packed but still, someone should have followed up and told us it was delayed

Desserts: creme brule and the lemon ""tiramisu"". Creme brule was divine and super tasty. The tiramisu should not be called a tiramisu. It's a lemon dessert with lady fingers inside. All it tasted was the lemon and nothing else. The lemon over powers all other tastes and makes it underwhelming.

Overall we want to go again."

"Market Lane",294,"J S",1111,"3 months ago",3,"We walked in for a weekday lunch, they were able to accommodate us right away. The staff were lovely.

There was a delay on our food, it took over 40min to get our mains from the time of ordering. Tables who were seated after us got their mains before we did.

The Smoked Chipotle Panisse main was underwhelming and bland - it was supposed to come with ‚Äúcrispy tortillas‚Äù but didn‚Äôt, and the rice was mostly cold and VERY dry. It all just tasted old. Very disappointing.

The Sardinian Seafood Pasta main was nice. The bread and butter pudding was incredible and a sizeable portion (suitable for sharing)!

Overall mixed feelings about Market Lane. Probably won‚Äôt go back again."

"Br√∫ Hostel",311,"Karlo Kramariƒá",1358,NULL,NULL,"Reason for such a low rating:

You don‚Äôt get what you pay for ‚Äî or even close.

Let‚Äôs start with the most important part:

1. The Room
We booked a 4-bed room ‚Äî the beds were quite old, and the room itself was extremely small. For four people, it was definitely not suitable. We could barely move around without bumping into each other. Every time someone needed to go to the bathroom, the rest of us had to move. We felt more like homeless people than tourists visiting a city.

2. Lounge with TV
Poorly maintained, and due to the furniture, it looked very old and messy. I wouldn‚Äôt even call it a lounge ‚Äî I‚Äôd rather stay in the tiny room than relax in that space.

3. Kitchen
There‚Äôs a kitchen next to the lounge. It includes ovens, a stove, fridges, and a microwave so you can cook your own meals. However, due to how everything looked and was arranged, it felt very uninviting. I‚Äôd honestly rather pay ‚Ç¨20 at a restaurant than cook in a kitchen that isn‚Äôt well-maintained.

4. ‚ÄúDining Area‚Äù
We expected a proper room where all guests could sit and eat. Instead, we ended up eating in a small space on high tables you usually see in bars. It felt more like we came for drinks than for breakfast.
If you want a good breakfast, I recommend going out instead. If you choose to eat at the hostel, you can only expect small spreads, toast, cereal, and coffee/juice. To be clear, it wasn‚Äôt a proper meal and we didn‚Äôt feel full afterwards.

All in all, after our stay we realized that we only paid for the location ‚Äî not for a comfortable room, a nice dining space, or a proper chill-out area.

The only positive thing was that the staff were polite and explained all the rules clearly.

If comfort and a pleasant stay aren‚Äôt important to you, then I‚Äôd recommend this hostel just as a place to sleep. But for those who are looking for a realistic price for realistic services ‚Äî meaning, you get what you pay for ‚Äî I strongly suggest going somewhere else.

If you're planning to head to Dublin after Cork, I highly recommend the Clink Hostel ‚Äî a big step up in every way."
"Dwyers Garden Caf√©",297,"David Brown",657,"2 years ago",5,"I have just had a full Irish breakfast here.. it was a total winner in my opinion. Well cooked, well presented and the staff members are very attentive and professional.
14.95 is the price and that includes coffee/tea and toast.
See you all soon.thanks"
"Dwyers Garden Caf√©",297,"Michael McCormack",1757,"7 months ago",2,"The patatas brave we had were undercooked, everyone working there was wearing tracksuits which didn't help the atmosphere. One of the staff had their own lunch while we were there and dropped some chips on the ground but left them there even though they definitely saw them fall. I hate to write bad reviews but there's just a touch of class missing from this place although I don't want to fault the attitude of most of the staff who were nice and work hard."
"Dwyers Garden Caf√©",297,"Patricia Meaney",1991,"3 years ago",3,"I was looking forward to trying here as the previous reviews were great but I really couldn‚Äôt see what all the fuss was about having visited there today. We arrived to an almost empty restaurant which was great, it was myself, husband and 3 small children. We found a seat, the place is quirky, decorated beautifully and spacious so far so good. My husband ordered at the counter, 3 kids smoothies, a Frappuccino, cappuccino, granola sundae, bagel with salmon and eggs Benedict, and scone and croissant for the kids to share with their smoothies.

Positives - the coffees were lovely and the kids enjoyed their smoothies which were a good size
My husband said the eggs Benedict were nice

Negatives- the service wasn‚Äôt great. The place was pretty quiet but everything took ages and all came separately. So we were almost finished our food by the time the smoothies arrived.

My daughter dropped a bit of her scone on the floor and the crumbs and dust underneath the table was awful. I can understand if it was later in the day and it had been used a few times but it looked like we were the first to sit at the table on the day.

The granola sundae was inedible, it was basically toasted oats and spoonfuls of jam in a sundae glass with a little bit of yogurt in between. I asked my husband to go up to ask for a bit more yogurt as it was far too sweet but he was told that they had run out of yogurt. It was about 11am at this time‚Ä¶

So overall a disappointing experience for almost ‚Ç¨55 spent"

"Dwyers Garden Caf√©",297,"Gavin Donohue",928,"2 years ago",5,"When we first came here, led by google maps, and realised this is a garden and home appliance shop with a cafe section, we hesitated but decided to give it a try. We‚Äôre glad we did because the sandwiches were tasty with fresh bread and nice combinations of ingredients. The tomato and basil soup was very nice too. The coffee was nicely made and presented. The barista has clearly had training and experience. We‚Äôve enjoyed the lattes! Prices were very reasonable. ‚Ç¨18.40 for a big sandwich, big soup and latte. The space is big and open which helps keep the noise down when it‚Äôs busy. They have tables at different levels including lower ones that suited us with an infant. The facilities included a changing table which we also appreciated. Easy listening 60‚Äôs music in the background that doesn‚Äôt crowd the space and provided a nice atmosphere. We‚Äôve come back here every time we‚Äôre shopping around the south of the city. We noticed that the chef has changed up the sandwiches so thanks to him/her for keeping it interesting. Also handy when you need a few bits and bobs around the house and garden because the main shop is well stocked with nice staff. Great job by management and all the staff."

"Perrotts Garden Bistro Restaurant",299,"john obrien",1269,"8 months ago",1,"""Disappointing Experience ‚Äì Bland Food, Overpriced, and Poor Service""

We visited this restaurant with high hopes for a nice family meal, but unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. There were four of us, and we ordered a variety of dishes to get a good sense of what the menu had to offer.

We started with the Goat's Cheese Mousse Salad, P√¢t√©, Arancini Balls, and Chicken Salad. All were incredibly plain, overpriced, and lacked any real flavour. For starters, these dishes could have been served at any budget restaurant, but here they were marked up far beyond what they were worth.

For the main course, we went with the Duck (‚Ç¨40), Lamb (‚Ç¨40), and Dover Sole. The Duck was dry, bland, and came with just a few baby carrots and flavorless potatoes. The Lamb was overcooked and equally tasteless. The Dover Sole was completely dry and lacked any seasoning or richness.

What really left us feeling deceived, however, was the price. We would have been disappointed with the food even at a lower price point, but when you‚Äôre paying ‚Ç¨100 per person, it‚Äôs simply not acceptable. To make matters worse, the service was lacking‚Äîstaff didn‚Äôt even bother to serve our wine, and our Calypso Coffee arrived cold.

The only redeeming feature of the evening was the Margarita cocktail, which was actually quite nice.

We will definitely not be returning. When you're paying premium prices, you expect premium food and service, and this restaurant failed to deliver on both."

"Perrotts Garden Bistro Restaurant",299,"Declan Ryan",692,"a year ago",5,"So there I was, in a 5 star hotel restaurant, waiting for my wife to enjoy and finish her company party. I had driven her 2.5 hours down in the afternoon and had a late night assignment to bring her home later that same night. It was gonna be a long night, so I went to the restaurant as I wanted some food.
I walked up, got greeted by the incredibly friendly staff, and given a table.
All around me were well to do people in beautiful suits and dresses, and here I was in jeans and a Reindeer Christmas jumper. I felt out of place. My server, Jelmer , let me know that the typical thing to do was to get one of each course and it included drinks and desserts etc etc. and it was going to cost far more than I was looking to spend.
Here I was just looking for a plate of chips and veg.
I felt like I was taking up a spot for someone willing to pay the expected amount. I nearly left there and then, apologising that I misunderstood what the restaurant was and worrying I was making a fool of myself.

However, any fears I had were quickly relieved when I explained myself to Jelmer. He alleviated my worries and worked with me through the menu and how to best take care of me. He assured me that I was just as much a priority as anyone else. I have a plant based diet and he didn't skip a beat. Without a worry or hesitation, he helped me through the menu and what I wanted.

A few minutes later, after some nice, soft bread with delicious dips, I was enjoying the FINEST vegetables and chips I had ever had. And very nice portions, too!

The service from not just Jelmer, but all the staff like Davar, made me feel more at ease, relaxed.
I was smiling the whole time I dined there. What better experience can you ask for?
I don't know what they do to get such great staff, but they are a credit to the Manor.
I had never heard of this place before, but now it's where I will recommend anyone looking to spend a night in Cork if they want a classy, friendly and relaxed experience.

I didn't even spend ‚Ç¨17, and I am stuffed.

Thanks Jelmar, and all of his wonderful co-workers. Including the lovely lady who helped me find a table with no prior notice given.
You made me feel very welcomed and comfortable. It means so much to me."

"Jack Forde's The Shandon Arm's",300,"Bill Bensing",340,"2 months ago",5,"A Night at The Shandon Arms

In Cork by the Lee where the old bells chime,
We wandered for pints and a grand old time.
At Jack Forde‚Äôs pub, the locals cheer,
And that‚Äôs where we ended, our nightcap‚Äôs here.

Behind the bar stood Tommy, sound as a bell.
Pouring the pints and spinning a tale.
He grinned as he whispered, ‚ÄúNow don‚Äôt be silly,
Ever tried a sweet called a Pennie Jelly?‚Äù

We laughed ‚Äòtil the stools near shook with delight.
Then Ryan walked in with a wink so bright.
‚ÄúThink you know stout?‚Äù said he with a grin,
‚ÄúBeamish, Murphy‚Äôs, Guinness, bet you can‚Äôt win!‚Äù

Bill puffed his chest, said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll ace this test!‚Äù
But Cork had a trick, and you know the rest.
He guessed them all wrong. What a sorry sight.
And bought every half-pint to make it right!

We clinked our glasses. The craic was strong.
Ryan and Nellie joined right along.
Stories of Moher and the Wild Atlantic Way,
And pubs where the fiddles and bodhr√°ns play.

Ryan gave tips in a voice so clear,
‚ÄúThe Long Hall in Dublin, don‚Äôt miss it, dear!
And the Butter Museum, sweet shops as well,
Linehan‚Äôs treats will cast their spell.‚Äù

So here‚Äôs our advice, if you roam this land,
Seek The Shandon Arms, where the locals stand.
And take the stout challenge, lose without fear.
For when you do, buy the lads a beer!

Sl√°inte!"

"Fionnbarra",302,"Kevin McCabe",1426,"3 years ago",5,"One of the best beer spots I‚Äôve found yet in Cork. They do have a full bar (also a great whiskey selection), but the focus is obviously beer, which is fine with me! I loved everything about it: the selection, the very friendly staff, the atmosphere, the board games, the huge garden space out back, etc.
We were there on a Sunday afternoon, so fairly quiet, but I have a hunch this place gets very busy in the evenings.
They had a pizza oven and seemed to make a small selection of pizzas. Also a huge selection of canned beers as well.
I will definitely be back‚Ä¶often. üçª"
"Fionnbarra",302,"alan keogh",102,"2 months ago",5,"A great bar on Douglas Street with a very good selection of craft beers and ciders. No Guinness or diageo products on draught. Lovely beer garden out the back. It's also a dog friendly venue. You can get pizza there too. I was there during the all Ireland hurling final and there were still some seats in the bar area when most other pubs in the city centre were packed or even had queues of people outside."
"Fionnbarra",302,"Andrew Donohoe",199,"5 months ago",2,"Unfortunately a very doughy pizza in the centre. Really poor, ingredients incredible, but when undercooked and so stodgy it's poor. Take a few minutes to bake better for a 15 euro pizza"
"Fionnbarra",302,"Phil Soltan",2045,"6 months ago",4,"Friendly atmosphere and staff. Good selection of drinks, great pizzas. It was very busy that night and we sat out the back, which was fine until the motorised windows closed when it got cooler, which didn't allow the tobacco smoke out and I went home stinking. I would return though."
"Fionnbarra",302,"Chris Townsend",483,"6 months ago",5,"What a place, pitched up to this very unassuming pub on a Sunday afternoon, and feel like we found a hidden gem of cork.

The rustic interior creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, also they combine the old Irish bar and various of art in the every single place. and the staff are friendly and attentive. They have fresh pizzas with a particular highlight on the fresh meat options. The price was fair (12-15‚Ç¨) . The drinks menu is equally impressive, with a vast selection of beers, wines, and spirits. Especially they have draft beer which is classic. Overall, Fionnbarra Restaurant is definitely worth a visit if you wanna experience the local place."

Today me and my friend got them and the price wasn't the issue, it was how in the entire spice bag we got 3 maybe 4 pieces of chicken smaller than McDonald's nuggets.

As a loyal costumer I have to say I'm dissapointed and will be exploring other options in future to hit my protein üò¢"
"Soba Express",304,"Nee Shen Ho",1864,"a year ago",4,"Was out on Thursday night, checked a few restaurants around the area and this was a place I get to eat dinner without reservation. What shocked me was the speed the food was served. I got my food less than 10 mins after ordering, and that's with a full house. My Pad Thai have the right amount of sour and spiciness. Fried Yaki Soba was a bit too sweet."

Good little surprise, I took a chicken katsu curry, not too expensive. The dish has been modernised a bit with some extra vegetables (spinach shoots and cherry tomatoes).
It was rather welcome, the base being very good, I validate this basic and well executed dish.

The service was also top notch!

It encourages me to come back and try more demanding dishes!

The decor is not really noticeable though, maybe the only black spot but I'm really picky, I had a good time."

"Soba Express",304,"Miroslaw Mrzyglod",1806,"a year ago",3,"The menu is promising, but the serving and cooking needs some refinement!
I liked sushi and rice the most...
I think it's worth taking care of details such as wooden chopsticks, clean menu cards (it's better to print them every day!) and not using plastic bento trays (!). Maybe it's better to serve this set of delicacies in a disposable paper box(?) or on several plates...
Be sure to add information on the menu whether it is vegetarian or not!
I will come back to you in some time. You have to improve!"

The staff were friendly and attentive even going above and beyond for our occasion. The cocktail specials were incredible and food scrumptious with hearty portions. Yummy!!!! ü§§
However, the starter menu was limited focusing heavily on fish/seafood, other options were generally limited.
Even with this limitation I will certainly be making a return as what I got I genuinely cannot fault."
"Greenes Restaurant",305,"P C",1963,"2 weeks ago",5,"Absolutely divine. This is by far one of the best meals we have had. Highly recommend the 3 course if you have a hearty appetite.

"Greenes Restaurant",305,"Heather Manz",1032,"4 months ago",4,"They were kind to fit us in on a busy Friday night. Alessia was our server and very sweet.  Cocktails were super fresh and had unique flavor profiles.  I had the Side Hustle,  and although it has Jalape√±o infused tequila,  the lime and agave cut the spiciness way down.  The Chicken with Mushroom Risotto was a solid dish,  could have used a bit more seasoning for my liking.  Chicken was tende and juicy, the combo of mushrooms gave great texture to the risotto. The steak was a perfect medium rare and flavors were nice, however,  I had a weird situation with my potato side dish.  I switched the mash the steak came with for the Colcannon, a local dish that is mash mixed with fresh cabbage, at the servers recommendation.  When the kitchen delivered the meal, I asked if these were the special potatoes, she looked confused, so I continued by adding ""the ones with the cabbage?"" She said she didn't know and rushed my plate back to the kitchen.  After several minutes passed, our server came to check and I explained that I had just asked to confirm I had gotten the right side. Side said I confused her when I said special. üòê  They finally redelivered my meal, after several more minutes, while my husband waited for me, and the potatoes were stone cold.  Alessia checked back and I told her the potatoes were very cold,  and she said they are supposed to be warm and not hot.  What?! This was pretty frustrating considering the food runner wasn't even sure what she was bringing to the table when I asked a simple question, and now I'm being told these ice cold potatoes are supposed to be like this?!  This was so awkward,  and I was ready to just leave. She returned shortly with steaming hot potatoes, which tasted pretty good.  Overall,  the evening wasn't ruined,  but it definitely put a damper on it. Overall,  good food,  just don't say special üòâ"
"Greenes Restaurant",305,"D C",587,"a month ago",4,"Lovely staff - friendly and attentive. Nice ambiance with a pretty, illuminated waterfall. Starters were tasty but mains were average. Fairly bland sea bass. Dessert menu was disappointing, not a huge selection and fairly basic. The cheese board was particularly poor value‚Ä¶.‚Ç¨14 for 3 pieces of cheese and 3 crackers, a handful of cashew nuts, some bread and some tired looking grapes is too expensive.

Got the chicken tacos and the birria with a side of tortilla chips
The chicken tacos were bland and completely dry considering it was big chunks of meat. the beef birria were good but not amazing there was large lumps of chewy beef too.
Not a good experience and very expensive for what we got and 8 euros for a handful of tortilla chips and a couple of small dips is extremely poor imo."

"The Frisky Whiskey",307,"Elena De Giorgi",782,"a year ago",4,"Nice pub. Good atmosphere.
Service was pretty slow, but there was a birthday party so I'm willing to believe that was the reason.
The problem for me was the lack of vegetarian options: the only vegetarian options were a plate of pesto pasta and 2 pizzas. As an Italian visiting Ireland, I'm not going to a ""traditional Irish pub"" to eat Italian food. I expected at least one slightly typical vegetarian option (even a burger would have made it tbh).
My boyfriend's stew was excellent though.
Fair prices for a fancy Irish pub.
Big extra point for the desserts which were excellent."

"Good Day Deli",308,"Philip Ziche",2052,"6 months ago",4,"Good food, good location, great service, what more could you want? This caf√©/restaurant is located in the courtyard of a former monastery, accessible via some rather steep stairs. But climbing them is worth it, because Good Day Deli is a true gem.

The small and modern hut offers indoor and outdoor seating, and as it was a sunny day, sitting outside in the sun was the best possible option. The brunch menu is rather small, but I'd say you'll definitely find something here. I opted for the pancakes that come with a hibiscus poached pear and coconut mascarpone. Not a big coconut fan but in combination and moderation it was good, and the pancakes were great. Wasn't too impressed with the price of their coffee, though.

I was recommended to try this place by locals and it was the very first thing I did after arriving in Cork. Go and try their brunch, it's really an experience!"

"Good Day Deli",308,"Arash",269,"2 months ago",4,"I enjoyed my visit to Good Day Deli at Nano Nagle Place. However, the high prices of the dishes were unexpected.

I ordered the fish tacos on their weekend lunch menu. It was served with homemade chips and accompanied with a herb aioli where there was a choice between herb and chipotle aioli.

The fish tacos were delicious and the chips were cooked perfectly and just like how I would cook chips at home, not overly greasy. The aioli tasted great too and I ended up dipping my chips into it.

The staff were kind and very knowledgeable about the menu. The atmosphere was superb, sitting indoors was like being in a log cabin in the middle of a nature reserve full of plants and trees outside.

Over ‚Ç¨20 for fish tacos did startle me at first, especially given that main dinner courses at restaurants around Cork are usually around this price nowadays. However, the local supply of ingredients and friendly service justified this cost.

I was surprised to find a seat on this day because within minutes of me sitting down, the shop was full and a queue was at the waiting area. I would recommend making a reservation on weekends if you are concerned about having to wait around peak meal times.

I would highly recommend Good Day Deli if you are in Cork city looking for lunch or a meal prepared from local ingredients, surrounded by nature. Just be prepared for a big bill."

Nice flavours and textures,I liked the desserts but the sandwiches were only ok the combinations I didn‚Äôt love.The tea I wanted they didn‚Äôt even have which I don‚Äôt understand why it was on the menu.

We were also seated below a ledge where other diners were above us it felt very cramped and the table was so tiny the tier had to be on its own little mini table beside.

Overall cute concept but too cramped."

She made sure to actually ask chef for my wings to be prepared to my liking. I like them extra crispy and cannot eat them when they are fatty in texture (sensory issue of mine)
Our food order:
Soup of the day, wings, sirloin steak. All cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious.
Our drinks order:
Bloom cocktail and Lemon Meringue cocktail. Both were very well made, the lemon meringue could easily do for a dessert.

Food, service and drinks 10/10
Thank you for a lovely experience and we both look forward to returning soon."

"Helena's Restaurant",309,"bryan conlon",392,"2 years ago",5,"5 Star afternoon tea.   I'm a bit allergic to these Afternoon Teas as they can be very hit and miss, however the offering at 'Sketch' was definitely a five star HIT.    Professionally looked after by Anais (spelling?) who seated us at very comfortable seats by the window.   We were then treated to a selection of very fine savouries, pastries, tea, coffee, and our package included a cocktail.   The attention to detail was outstanding from the chef and I'd say, one of the best Afternoon Teas we've had to date.
There was a lot of food and Anais packed our leftovers in a very posh doggy bag to enjoy at home - and we did.     A very special treat - BOOK IT.    BTW.   The hotel needs 24 hour notice for Afternoon Tea."

"Br√∫ Hostel",311,"Sam Lott",2226,NULL,NULL,"I‚Äôm going to tell these story and be honest about this hundred percent not out of any kinda revenge but the truth needs to be told. I had left my passport at this place. I tried to return before I hear the owner say whatever she is going to say this is a fact I slept in the street after I left because I didn‚Äôt have a passport the man who worked there said it was not his problem, yes I yelled at him and yes, I was wrong for that but if anything had happened to me that night god forbid I been hurt or sexual assaulted as I slept on the cold ground it be on you. Before you talk about abuse true awful evil is when you don‚Äôt care. Your employe said it wasn‚Äôt his problem I hope none of you are ever homeless. So have a nice life and know that I may not be perfect but at least I wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone it‚Äôs not there problem when they are need. That‚Äôs why I did what I did was it right , no will you open your eyes and see that if I had been hurt or raped, you would have been on your hands but oh, wait that‚Äôs not your problem. True abuse, true selfish acts.
I say this now calmly without any rage but final question if I been hurt or raped would it have been your problem? If the  answer is no you can‚Äôt play any moral higher games because truly the nasty most hateful thing someone can say is ‚ÄúNot my problem‚Äù
That‚Äôs why I lost control that is why I got angry because I doubt you care if someone is on the street I been homeless twice as an adult in my twenty nine years of existence and let me tell you that is something you don‚Äôt want. So before you say he wasn‚Äôt abusive not caring is abuse! Not giving damn is why I did what I did and if you feel after reading this that it still is not your responsibility if someone is on the street or has no where to go that it‚Äôs not your problem you have no right to say anything about me or my mistake I should have walked away from the situation but when people don‚Äôt care it‚Äôs very hard not to despise them.

"Br√∫ Hostel",311,"Mariella Wilcke",1635,NULL,NULL,"Clean, hot, loud

Edit after 2 nights: room unbearably hot, loud self-closing doors banging all night, so wouldn't recommend.

Functional and clean, fine for a couple of nights if you just need a place to sleep, not a place to spend any daytime in.
Communal areas are clean. Kitchen is ok for cooking only. Has no window.
The ""TV lounge"" is not the cozy place you might imagine. It's a clean windowless space with a wall-mounted TV and several bar stools.
4-bed-dorms are tiny, dark, clean, functional. Very loud ventilation shaft right outside window, loud even with window closed. Still, it's OK for sleeping so long as you use earplugs. Each bed has its own lamp but no curtains.
Beds are strangely short, even for me - I'm1.63m - and not too comfortable. Matresses should really really be replaced.
Staff are friendly.

Unfortunately, I have to take one star off my initial 3 star review. Room was incredibly hot with heating on full throttle all night. Every time I turned the radiator down, one person in my room would turn it on full again.
Why's the heating on all night anyway in late april?
Heating in bathroom couldn't be turned off at all.
I spoke to two different members of staff about this, both seemed to be very understanding and promised to turn the heating's timer off for the next night. Neither of them did.

Other guests were very inconsiderate - even for a hostel. There is no need to bang the doors all night (they're self-closing doors, so this is, at least in part, the hostel's fault), nor to pee standing up every single time you use the shared, mixed bathroom, and make a big mess.

I stayin hostels frequently when travelling, and I use earplugs, so I'm usually alright for sleep. In this hostel, I could barely sleep 3 hours due to overheating and banging doors all night.
Of course, the hostel doesn't encourage this kind of behaviour, but it is the way it is, and they don't do anything to stop it."

To start- I have been following 5 points online for a looooong while. I have been waiting since they have opened to try their illusive bagels.

Unfortunately every single time, my attempt to secure one of these doughy lads was unsuccessful as they are always sold out. üßé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüßé‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Joyous be the day I finally get to try their bagel. I thought.

Unfortunately x2; I finally had the opportunity to be in Cork early enough to snatch one. I sauntered in and to my dismay, they don‚Äôt offer take away. Not even for a plain bagel with no toppings. But luckily (I thought) the lady behind the bar blessed me (I thought) with a single bagel take away. No toppings. No cream cheese on the side. Not even a measly caper. Fine. I will take it. The bagel should be good enough to stand on its own.

I waited with bated breath the entire journey home. Ecstatic to try my bagel. I had dreams of it comparing to the bagels I‚Äôve had previously in America.

Omg. Omg. Omg. When I tell you this bagel was TRAGIC- it‚Äôs literally just bread dough SHAPED INTO A BAGEL. Cue the vine Boom sound effect. What the hell?! Why lie about your bagels 5 points?! Not only was the bagel just bread. It wasn‚Äôt even good bread. It was dense and dry asf. What the hell x2.

I have included images of the imposter bagel for reference. Just looking at the crumb should tell you that‚Äôs not a bagel.

Girl please fix your bagels. This rouse cannot go on any longer. I pain for a decent bagel in Ireland."

The staff were fantastic they actually made the experience of the food some bit reasonable for the price. With the profits this company is making I hope they are well paid. Between high Vat rates and the cost of living I still can't see how these high prices are justified. Was definitely expecting more from this restaurant.
There is a few options to order you can order via a QR code at the table the staff at the counter.
The food was not filling for the price, but it was definitely very tasty and cooked very well.
Service was very fast. The interior design is very impressive with lots of seating. They accept cash and card and there is also a tipping station for the staff at the counter. Great staff that check to see if you are happy with your food and service when needed. This would have been 5 stars but quantities of food expensive price. It was the staff that got this a three star review and not less."

I ordered chicken wings, a burger, and a wrap, but the meat was completely flavorless ‚Äî a really poor meal.

"Nando's Cork - Academy Street",316,"Colman Kelliher",554,"a year ago",1,"Disgusted with my food from Nandos in  Cork city centre

Ordered  the double chicken pitta , and a portion of Fries, presuming it would look like the photo of it on the app for ordering. ( If i had read correctly I would have seen that it was only the pitta included but I would have gotten over that)

Food cost around 20‚Ç¨.
The presentation of the food was appalling, there was so little salad in the pitta, the chicken was so dry I could barley swallow it, fries were cool and very few for ‚Ç¨4.50.

The waiters were nice .

Couldn‚Äôt believe how bad the experience was"

"The Southern Star",317,"Mr Walsh",1829,"a year ago",5,"This is a great pub that has fantastic filling food. It even surprises more with such a spacious area out the back there is a large beer garden. When you walk in first you would be mistaken that it is a small pub but continue on into the pub and it's like two different establishments in one. With a large beer garden out the back and a great pint and value for money.

It is also in the City just a 10 min walk from the heart of the Centre of Cork and away from all the hustle. It is conveniently located within walking distance in a nice area.

It's also close to Douglas and closer to the City Centre. So plenty of choice for a night out. A comfortable atmosphere the Southern Star also has a pool table music and a thoughtful interior. This pub is also pet friendly with great characters. Definitely worth a visit the menu is up-to-date the food served quickly and was fantastic."

The lack of professionalism and questionable after-hours behaviour were deeply disappointing.

What‚Äôs worse, after leaving my honest opinion, I received an intimidating message. That says more about the place than any review could.

I was a regular customer. I expected decency, not fear.

Not sure if management is aware, but if they are, that alone should be a red flag.

The setting was lovely, and the service was solid, our single waiter handled the large group with care, was friendly, and got all the orders right, which we really appreciated. Unfortunately, the food didn‚Äôt quite live up to expectations. We all ordered from the main menu, and while the dishes varied, the general consensus was that the food was average at best. A particular letdown was the ‚Äúseared lemon sole fillet‚Äù which turned out to be just deep-fried fish in batter, more like pub grub than the refined dish the menu description suggested. To her credit, the manager acknowledged our concerns and made adjustments to the bill, which we appreciated. Still, for a venue like this - a 4 start hotel, the kitchen needs to up their game. Nice atmosphere, good service , but the food fell short of the mark."

Highly recommend the Jacob's ladder - it was fantastic. Steak sandwich was alright as well - the peppercorn sauce was the best part.
Service was a bit slow but they didn't seem to have many folks working on a Wednesday night, so I can understand that.
Dinner and dessert for 2 was under ‚Ç¨50 - very worth it."

"An Spailp√≠n F√°nach",321,"Kevin Byrne",1413,"2 years ago",4,"This is an underrated bar in my opinion.  It's somewhat of an institutionz and when it comes to an authentic Irish bar with a welcoming and authentic Irish Music session, you couldn't go wrong with the Spailp√≠n. Situated in the heart of Cork City, the place (I think) takes it's name from the infamous  Irish Poem ""An Spailp√≠n F√°nach"" (meaning the wandering labourer), a poem that describes the harshness of living as a roving labourer in 18th Century Ireland. There is a session that welcomes everyone once a week running in this bar downstairs and concerts (such as during the Cork Folk Festival) are held upstairs.  There is a small stage and a deceptively good sound system upstairs for festival gigs. I like the lighting in this pub, it's a mix of candles and really old lamp shades.  A regular haunt for sure and worth a visit if you haven't been."

"Edison",322,"Jonathan",1286,"2 months ago",1,"Visited a couple of weeks ago with friends and had a generally positive experience. The staff were very friendly, and the venue was absolutely packed, which made for a lively atmosphere.

However, the music was a major letdown. PlayHouse were performing on the night, and unfortunately, the DJ came across as quite rude. His mixing skills left a lot to be desired, and according to my friend, he played an identical set just weeks earlier.

Cork has a rich history when it comes to house music ‚Äî it deserves better. While the crowd and energy were great, the musical quality seriously missed the mark."
"Edison",322,"John Browne",1249,"4 years ago",5,"Absolutely delighted with my visit here. Staff were fantastic, friendly, helpful and brilliant overall. Quite a busy night with the local youth's celebrating their return to college. Great atmosphere.

At one point however there was a homeless man passing who was in a poor mental state. He was loitering close to the building and causing a bit of a scene.

The owner (I presume) was fantastic in dealing with this, and he showed great patience and compassion when dealing with the man, who was obviously fairly troubled. Great to see some bit of humanity in these times.

The service? Impeccable. Attentive without being overbearing, and genuinely warm from start to finish.

A special shout-out to Bruno, whose kindness and care made the whole evening feel extra special. He made sure everything we ordered was just right, and it absolutely was.

Obrigada!"

It was absolutely delicious, so comforting, I can‚Äôt get over the rice, it‚Äôs the perfect balance of flavour and I love how Brazilians make rice,
as an Irish person I know we can find new foods and cuisines intimidating but I honestly think this has amazing flavour, not to mention huge value, the portion sizes we got with the delivery were huge. Would definitely recommend and can‚Äôt wait to order again.
We recommend the pichana steak and rice both very delicious, the beans are good too, just not a favourite of mineüôÇ a very well rounded meal. Thank you"
"SABOR BRAZIIL",323,"4HEIST",2,"2 months ago",5,"Absolutely lovely place! Very nice and cozy, with the soft Brazilian music on the background. I was with my Brazilian friend in here, the good man Bruno was serving us ‚Äì very friendly, helpful and absolute professional of his work, felt like we knew him all of my life.

We highly recommend it and will definitely be back soon."

"51 Cornmarket",324,"Alan O'Brien",105,"a month ago",4,"Popped in with my wife on a Saturday evening and wow was it busy!!! A great sign for a place right?

First, the food. The menu is very interesting with an excellent selection. I had pickled muscles for start, and the rump for main. The pickled muscles were tasty, but somewhat lacking the actual flavour of being pickled. The Rump was a touch overdone and not served with a side which was surprising. My wife had fried oysters to start, and steak tartar for main.

I see in other comments that the owner has defended the cost while talking about challenging prices in the business. I would see this as fair, however, it would stand to reason that serving a steak in sauce and nothing else with it is a somewhat sad looking plate. If other business are managing a little something on the side, it may be worth taking a look at how the dish is presented here.

The atmosphere was busy, however downside of this was that it would be easier to hold a conversation next to a screaming toddler than here due to the mighty background noise. This is not really the fault of the restaurant as it is the size that it is, just be aware that you may need to perfect your lip reading before arriving.

The staff were lovely and very helpful so a big thanks to them!

Would I come back? No, too loud but that is just a me problem."

The staff were all so lovely, even though they were  constantly on the go the whole night as it was very busy.
We thought it was very good value for the high level of food.
The wine menu was very good too with lots of choice.
A gem of a restaurant, and we will definitely be back."

"Alchemy Coffee and Bookstore",325,"J Cronin",1108,"3 months ago",5,"Like most places, the experience can depend on when you visit. The first time I visited, it was very busy and the music was loud. I was a little put off then, but there was a potential about the place that I felt I hadn't experienced as it had a clean yet rustic vibe that I loved. The second time I visited, the music was low, and it was quiet with a chilled ambience. The cappuccino was good, and there was water available as well. The seating was very comfortable too. The only question on both visits was the staff were be a little distant.
Overall, I'd definitely visit again."

Looking forward to returning:)"
"Holy Smoke Kitchen",326,"tiny lily",2502,"7 years ago",4,"The food here is amazing... everything was really well cooked and tasted wonderful, I'd happily work my way through the menu over the course of several months. The service on my visit though was frankly appalling, slow and slightly shambolic. I was brought the wrong drink, sauces were taken away when we'd requested them to be left (and they then charged us for more later) and menu items were substituted without telling us. Service alone would be two stars, the really good food would be five and will get me coming back if I come to Cork again."
"Holy Smoke Kitchen",326,"Diego Maria Ricigliano",726,"Edited 6 years ago",5,"Surely the best BBQ restaurant in Cork. The brisket is magical. The restaurant is a must go.

Sliders with pulled pork okay, some small sausages as a starter were actually not bad. Ambiente a bit boring and too dark, but the staff is attentive. Bowling and pool upstairs  but no parking close by."
"Holy Smoke Kitchen",326,"Uge Ursua",2553,"Edited 5 years ago",5,"They offer fresh Irish meat (beef, pork, free range chicken) which are char-grilled, pit-smoked low n slow, or bbq ed. We ordered pork baby back ribs which has a delicious mouthwatering wet rub, meat are all tender. Rib eye steak was char grilled over fire which has a legit smoky flavor. Serving sizes are huge. Ambiance is cozy, crowds are usually in group of young people. Staff are friendly and attentive. The prices are reasonable, might spend roughly ‚Ç¨25-30 for main + dessert + pint.
However, parking is limited within the street.
Reservations might be needed during the weekends.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"

"South County",328,"Connor Rea",557,"3 months ago",2,"Honestly one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a pub, having worked in pubs for nearly 15 years I understand you can get busy but at least acknowledge the customer.

10 mins to even get served, paid for the pint and waited over 10 mins to watch a half poured pint sit there so I left.

I'm sure this establishment is fantastic but on this occasion this wasn't a good experience."
"South County",328,"Adrian Bradley",54,"4 years ago",5,"Booked in to the South County for the first time since re-opening. Online booking system made it simple to secure a table and we were sat outside of course. The beer garden is newly refurbished, it's bright and spacious. The weather was fantastic but they have temporary gazebos covering the area in case you're not so lucky on other days. The food was excellent as always and the pints were every bit as good (very welcome after nearly 6 months without them). My girlfriend had an aperol spritz which was their cocktail special for the day. We were well looked after by the staff who checked in regularly and were very attentive.
Still my favourite pub in Douglas! All the best to the owners and staff with the re-opening. Will definitely be back."

"Guji Coffee Bar",329,"Ani Barry Lain",214,"9 months ago",1,"5,50‚Ç¨ for this capuchino with coconut milk. Is a small size. Not even a large size. If you guys are all millionaires good for you. But this is starting to be a joke like.

You can get a large amazing capuchino with all the syrup you want and coconut/almond milk in Circle K for 3,80‚Ç¨. I can‚Äôt get over the actual insanity of prices here.

Edit after reply: We read other comments when filtering with Price and they all complain about the same thing. Regarding of your investment in this business, it IS the highest price in the market. If people do like you all around that area for competition, soon there will come a day we‚Äôll be paying 10‚Ç¨ for a coffee like that. So no, it‚Äôs not healthy for the market. Instead of dropping already inflated prices you are inflating even more. That shouldn‚Äôt be the norm in the under-paid society we are currently living in."

What used to be the best steak sandwich in Cork was removed from the menu (who's bright idea was that) and it's basically 14 euro for a fancy ham and cheese toasty now and the other new sandwiches are basic are overpriced.

"Nando's Cork - Mahon Point",332,"Bee",319,"a year ago",5,"Needed a G converter so we stopped at the mall. We were not disappointed to see this place for lunch. I highly advise against ordering on line. Just a scam to get your email.  They will let you order at counter after they seat you with menus. We ordered chicken thighs stuffed pita,(medium ), slaw,fries and peri-mac& cheese. Every thing was delicious.  I normally don't order Mac n cheese but was not disappointed.  I think if they created a Mac n cheese with chicken thighs on top it would be amazing. The place was super clean . the staff kept busy and very helpful.  It was noon on a Thursday."

"Nando's Cork - Mahon Point",332,"kieran Kenneally",1438,"a year ago",2,"First time here, just not for me.
Dining out should be an enjoyable experience with good service being part of that experience.
When you have to go the counter to order, get your own cutlery, get your own drinks... what's the point? I do all that at home!
Menu is very limited for me. Look, its essentially just chicken!
I also feel bad for the staff, customers ordering and paying online or when they go to the counter and order must have a terrible affect on tipping. I mean, how can you judge how much to tip your server when that server hasn't served you because of the systems the restaurant has in place (essentially self service).
On the actual food, my wife's was nice but then it was just loaded chips and it's hard to mess that up.
My food was just OK but my daughter had a quarter chicken dish with chips and rice and I can honestly say I've seen more chicken on a wing than what she got. She told me she was sorry she didn't order wings!
Never again for me, I need better choices, actual service and a better overall experience."
"Nando's Cork - Mahon Point",332,"Praveeni Kaluarachchi",2068,"Edited 10 months ago",2,"Update 1st December 2024
Thankfully they have improved their ordering method and if you would like you can order at the till to avoid their scan and order method.
Unfortunately I was disappointed with my order today. I ordered a spicy rice bowl with two chicken thighs and I was served spicy rice bowl with a flavourless chicken breast.

At very first day (somewhere in July) their food was nice, but later we felt that they are not as ,good as it was. Their online ordering system is a hassle. Nandos free WiFi is very slow and it takes more than 20mins to place an order or impossible to place an order via their online system.  We get to starve before we get our food everytime we visit there. So, we try to avoid this place now."
"Nando's Cork - Mahon Point",332,"‰∏ªÂ∏∏Ëéπ",2669,"2 years ago",4,"Everything was overall great! Very tasty and well cooked. Most of the beverages were bottomless and you can choose among different sauces. You have to set up your table.
And here the only ‚Äúbad‚Äù thing: I ordered a can of iced tea, which I didn‚Äôt like but it‚Äôs my personal taste, because I wanted still water but there wasn‚Äôt on the online men√π. I discovered too late it was free and infinitely refillable."
"Nando's Cork - Mahon Point",332,"Chloe Ogweng",468,"2 years ago",5,"I don't know what it is about this particular Nando's branch, but they literally attract the BEST staff? As in, compared to all the dining establishments I've been to EVER, the staff here are seriously some of the best. It's mind-blowing. And I would have visited here, four times over nearly two years? All different staff members, all of them ranging from very pleasant to 11/10. This time, Nadia was the standout. I can't really remember the last time I experienced such amazing customer service at a restaurant, so absolutely kudos to you, girl!

Staff aside (like they aren't reason enough to visit) this Nando's tends not to be that busy, AND they tend to be stocked with everything, which can be a real problem at some branches. Everything came out quickly, it was hot and it's Nando's so like, what's to complain about?

The location is fab too, perfect for grabbing a meal before or after a film, especially if it's one of the slightly later ones as most days, they're open until 10. The loos are always clean, and they've even gotten rid of the QR codes, which is great because they never worked for me. So now, you can just order off the menu directly at the till! It really is the little things.

5 stars!"

"Dashi Deli Sushi & Noodle Bar",73,"Ciara O'Connor",507,"6 months ago",1,"I am not usually the type to leave a bad review online, however I think in this circumstance it is warranted, and will serve as a warning to future customers!
First and foremost, I have been to Dashi Sushi on a few other occasions and I think it is fair to say that the staff are not the friendliest/boarding on rude. So with that said, I never have high hopes regarding the service but overall I have enjoyed the food.

This evening I was really looking forward to treating myself to some sushi as I had some child free time. Upon entering I placed my order and as I was waiting to ask the staff member for a straw, I took a short video of the sushi on the display counter to send to my friend. There was no member of staff near me or even in the direction I was filming. As I was still waiting for service I could see the two women talking and frowning to one another until eventually the owner came to me and asked me why I was recording in her restaurant. I was honestly in such shock and taken back by the tone at which she approached me. I told her I took a short video of the sushi to send to my friend, which she again asked why, and replied that it was a strange thing to do! Implying I some kind of nefarious motives for doing so which was absolutely not the case. She also implied I had recorded her staff member and I have no idea why they thought this- or why I would want to do this? Obviously this video was taken as I liked the display! She said ‚Äòdid you not see the sign on our door‚Äô to which I said no, clearly I did not. I looked for a sign as I left but didn‚Äôt see one then either so maybe make a bigger sign of it‚Äôs this much of an issue? To go out of your way to embarrass and argue with someone when it‚Äôs pretty clear they are not doing anything malicious is pretty crazy and a sure way to lose customers. She went on asking why I did this once again highlighting how it was strange behaviour on my part! Clearly trying to embarrass me and continue an argument. I was speechless because in this day and age- is it really strange to take photos or videos in a restaurant? They even have a whole section of their own instagram dedicated to customers photos/videos. I also sent them the recording I took to prove that nobody was in it. She then told me I was getting defensive- and when I tried to diffuse the situation by saying I think it was a misunderstanding and that she got the wrong end of the stick- she snapped back at me. You really couldn‚Äôt make it up. There were so many better ways she could of approached this situation but unfortunately she choose a bad one, hence my negative review.  If she had kindly told me they didn‚Äôt like videos being taken on the premises that is no problem- instead she chose to accuse me of videoing a staff member with zero proof, keep prying at me and insinuate what I did was weird when it was not.

I was so mortified as all the other customers overheard the whole thing and were clearly made feel uncomfortable also. I sat down to wait for my food as I didn‚Äôt want it to ruin my evening, however the atmosphere was noticeably bad and I was made to feel very unwelcome for the duration of my meal. I would say this is the strange behaviour- not mine.

I can confirm I will not be back and will be telling others to avoid."

"Goldie",217,"Sun Lee",2417,"a week ago",5,"Located on Plunkett Street which is one of the many lively bar streets but on the good side (the other side of Plunkett is filled with vagrants and beggars)

I canceled my other dinner once I was able to book a table here. Enter into a young woman chef who made her bones at Elbow Lane, her modern take a fish (seafood) forward restaurant that's ever changing based on the contents of the freshest catch.

Not fussy but luxe. I requested bar seating so had front row view of the efficiency and attention to detail the kitchen staff took to everything from expedite to managing the front of house staff.

Word to the wise their small plates showcase the immense talent of Aishling and her chef de cuisines:

For my order :

Taiwan fish nuggets; beautiful rendition on my childhood favorite Taiwanese popcorn chicken, which uses white pepper for nostalgia feel that always sparks joy. Goldie's take has more Indian spices which was lovely and the fish was fried to perfection, not greasy whatsoever. How Chef Anna didn't get the famous basil pop in the oil, I'll never figure out....perhaps that's why she gets paid the big bucks! Incredible technique.

Cod schnitzel; gherkin and celeriac combo is one of my favorites with a twist by adding more Dijon mustard reminded me of my last trip to Lyon. Soy sauce cured egg yolk will add the additional saltiness the dish craves on anything fried.

Pibil cod head & cheek sope; the sope was one of the best executions I've seen since Pujol's (MXC) version. How this dish doesn't become soggy and gross speaks to their talent.

Main: pan roasted to perfection monkfish with beetroot achar, apple katkut - look my pictures. un fing real. Monkfish is seldomly seen in the states and when I do make it it's usually chopped up in congee with tons of ginger and scallions. Love this French? take of this ugly ass fish lol

Fish tends to be a lighter option for dinner, so with any luck you‚Äôll have room for dessert; i was completely stuffed by made the right decision in ordering caramelized white chocolate with the Achill Island sea salt and milk sorbet and the bucket wheat cracker. Unbelievable touch that was light air and not cloying.

Whilst sitting at dinner I found out Chef Aishling was recently awarded Ireland's Best Chef 2024 and Goldie is listed as the #2 restaurant in Ireland's Top 100 restaurants. The Bib Gourmand rating is what brought us here, and they were absolutely correct.

Chef Rob - expedition was exceptional. His command of the job came second nature to him, being able to manage several chefs and front of staff. Giving meaningful instruction without being overly dominant yet letting his young staff express  their creativity is what talented Chefs do. Really appreciate him coming by to check up on me after the service.

Chef Anna - plating was gorgeous and really appreciated her time expanding on each dish to me in person, such a lovely hospitality touch. This is totally an aside, but she was the most beautiful woman I've ever seen on my trip to Ireland. she's an absolute beauty.

Front of staff was excellent - I showed up 30 mins early to my reservation but suggested I grab a drink over at Brennan's. Really enjoyed it!"

We had booked a table in advance hoping for faster service, but despite arriving 10 minutes early, we waited over 40 minutes for our food.

I ordered a steak, which was absolutely terrible, easily the worst I‚Äôve ever had. I asked for medium rare and got an overcooked, chewy, old piece of meat that was completely misdescribed. It wasn‚Äôt even the right cut to be called a steak. One bite and I genuinely felt like vomiting.

To top it off, we asked for two Coke Zeros during the meal. They never arrived until after we finished eating, only when a waiter came to check in, and we reminded him, he started writing so it seems the other waiter didn‚Äôt even take the order. No apology, no urgency, nothing.

On top of all, so overpriced, we paid 90‚Ç¨ for a fake steak (not) and a fajita chicken with guacamole starter. I‚Äôm so so angry üò§ I paid this much for the worst food and service.

I‚Äôm leaving this place hungry, frustrated, and disgusted. Not only would I never come back, I genuinely wish we never came at all."

I've been longing to taste the delicious flavours I can smell on these nights and my visit in a group of 16 friends did not disappoint. Delicious and welcoming.

"Good for the Soul",340,"Blake Norton",350,"2 weeks ago",3,"The food is fantastic. Great intention, artistry, balance. Top class.

The staff is very nice, but they were increasingly stressed due to the influx of customers, which made the whole (small) restaurant feel stressed as our meal went on. I'm not blaming them, but it definitely impacted our experience. As we were eating, there was a queue forming by us of people coming in the front door. And we're on a small two-person table that genuinely feels like it's going to get knocked over by the throng of people. The location isn't built / designed for both people sitting down, at least how it's laid out, and a large queue.

We were looking around to pay for a few minutes near the end of the meal and all the staff seemed preoccupied, so I asked the gentleman who had served us if I should pay at the counter, and he said yes. So I queued behind people coming in for takeaway coffees for a few minutes after the service had been to the table up to that point. I found this kind of messy, to be queuing twice for the same meal.

The kicker as to why we're unfortunately not enthusiastic to go back, a lady came in with a dog under her arm whose butt was looming-cum-hovering over my wife's food. This seems to be okay with the management, as she was seated and all, but the mix of flying dog and artisan eggs is not a good breakfast vibe.

Amazing food, real nice staff, but too stressy and weirdly laid out to be a relaxing experience for us. My wife didn't finish the end of her food after the dog arrived, which makes the wonderful quality of the food more of a taunt than a benefit in that moment. Ha."
"Good for the Soul",340,"Steve O'Rourke",2404,"Edited a month ago",1,"Disappointing Experience at ‚ÄúGood for the Soul‚Äù

I had high hopes for this place given the name, but sadly, the experience was anything but comforting. One of the most frustrating aspects was the complete lack of flexibility with the menu‚Äîwhen I asked to make a simple adjustment to a dish, I was told it wasn‚Äôt possible, without any real explanation or effort to accommodate.

Service was another major letdown. My coffee arrived 25 minutes before my food, which meant I had to drink it lukewarm or wait and enjoy it cold. Either way, not ideal. To make things worse, the general service attitude felt inattentive and inconsistent.

There was a young woman with red hair working behind the till who was noticeably friendly and loud with regulars, laughing and chatting openly. But when it came to new customers like myself, she made no effort to be welcoming or even polite‚Äîjust a quick, impersonal transaction that felt borderline dismissive.

All in all, the vibe was cliquey and the service lacked basic hospitality. I won‚Äôt be returning, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it unless you‚Äôre already part of the inner circle.

This review is up over a week and still no reply or enquiry from the management team at good for the soul tells me all i need to know about the type of business you are conducting."

There isn‚Äôt an a la carte menu here.  So understand that.  You will not be disappointed with the food.

"The Crane Lane Theatre",342,"Dee Forde",695,"a month ago",1,"One of our friends, the only black member of our group, wasn't allowed in because she was 'too drunk'. She wasn't.. it was 9pm and we had just come from dinner. When I noticed she wasn't with us, I went to find her (she had been trying to call us but we didn't hear our phones) and she told me the bouncer wouldn't let her in to tell us. She was apparently too drunk to enter the pub but not to isolate from her friends. When I looked over at the bouncer, he had a smirk on his face.. and we knew he would have loved the opportunity to escalate it if we argued. All five of us (women in our 30s and 40s) have worked in pubs over the years and we know this type of dude... The type who enjoys his job because he gets to exercise power and discriminate. I got my friends and we left.
I'm from Cork and my friends were visiting with me. I'm so embarrassed they experienced this in my city, and my friend, so used to experiencing racism her whole life, was subjected to it in Cork.
I've read the other reviews and this appears to be an issue that no one is addressing at these venues."

"The Crane Lane Theatre",342,"Tanya Guerin",2445,"5 months ago",1,"I live overseas and hadn‚Äôt been to The Crane in about 20 years. Out of nostalgia, I wanted to go back.

We got cocktails upstairs, each with a jaw-dropping price tag of ‚Ç¨14! After wiping away my tears and having a lengthy discussion with the bartender about our preferences, we agreed on two drinks. Mine was delicious. My sister‚Äôs, however, wasn‚Äôt to her liking and didn‚Äôt match what she had described to the bartender.

Given the high price, we expected there might be an option to have the drink replaced. Absolutely not‚Äîwe were told it‚Äôs the bar‚Äôs policy to never replace a drink. For prices that steep, this policy is ridiculous. If a venue is going to charge premium prices, there should be gold-standard guarantees that the final product aligns with the customer‚Äôs expectations. In this case, it didn‚Äôt‚Äîand unfortunately, the staff couldn‚Äôt do anything to help. In fact, I overheard the bartender say that replacing a drink could jeopardize their job, which is really sad.

If you're looking for a cool place to enjoy amazing cocktails, avoid this one. There are far nicer places in Cork that serve better drinks and actually appreciate their customers."

We don‚Äôt eat meat, so I asked if we could just have eggs and toast. The girl said yes, but only scrambled was available. We ordered two portions with tea.

When it arrived, each plate was just one slice of toast with a small spoon of scrambled egg on top with some mini cherry tomatoes we did not ask for. The total came to ‚Ç¨27.98 ‚Äî I was shocked. I even asked if it was a mistake, but was told no, that was the correct price.

Nearly ‚Ç¨28 for two teas, two slices of toast and a tiny bit of egg is outrageous. To make matters worse, we noticed the Dunnes caf√© just outside offering a full breakfast with tea and toast for ‚Ç¨5.50 each. If only we had seen that first.

It completely spoiled our morning. We won‚Äôt be back, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone who values fair prices and decent portions."

"Puccino's Cafe",344,"Igor Ara√∫jo",1074,"Edited 2 years ago",5,"If you're looking for a laid-back place to have lunch, this restaurant is worth checking out. Situated inside a shopping centre, it offers a convenient location for a quick bite. While the prices might be a little on the higher side, it's understandable considering the expenses that come with operating in such a prime location.

The menu at this restaurant is fantastic, boasting a wide selection of delicious dishes to satisfy diverse palates. However, one small suggestion would be to include pictures of the plates on the menu. This would be especially helpful for those who aren't familiar with the options or prefer a visual representation before making a decision. It can be a bit challenging to order quickly since you have to decide and place your order before finding a seat. The bustling queue behind you doesn't leave much time for contemplation or inquiries.

Despite these minor quirks, it's a great spot to enjoy a casual lunch. The food is of high quality, and the overall dining experience is enjoyable. So, go ahead and give it a try. Relax, indulge, and have a great time!"

"The Thomond Bar",349,"A J (Lexi)",14,"a month ago",5,"Amazing place. I heard the music walking down the street and was drawn in. The band was incredibly talented. They blended the music so well it was hard to tell when they switched songs. Great tracks from Abba, Elvis, Black Eyed Peas etc but in an acoustic version. I wish I had got the name of the band. We were there last Saturday. I had this bar on my list for Cork and had somehow crossed it off as if we had been there already. So glad fate had us walk by. In my top 5 favorites!! The music was the best in all Cork that night. Oh and cherry on top: they have Beamish!"
"The Thomond Bar",349,"George W.",947,"2 months ago",5,"We stopped in for a brew and rested our feet from walking. Many beers and ciders are offered on tap. I enjoyed the Rockshore Lager. It was very refreshing. The staff were friendly and helpful. Sports aplenty showing in the TVs. I would love to visit again."
"The Thomond Bar",349,"Ruth Kershaw",2197,"4 months ago",5,"Absolutely delicious Irish food, both of us would rate our meals 11/10, it was that good. Atmosphere was great and staff were lovely. I wish I could order the food to England! Highly recommend visiting."
"The Thomond Bar",349,"Wayne Phair",2599,"a month ago",5,"A fantastic Irish bar full of character! Great selection of ales and plenty of food choices to suit everyone. The staff were really welcoming and up for a good laugh, which made the atmosphere even better. Perfect spot whether you‚Äôre after a proper meal, just a quick stop-off after some shopping, or even a cosy escape from the rain. Highly recommend!"
"The Thomond Bar",349,"Heather Lynn Cournoyer",1031,"6 months ago",2,"The atmosphere was fun! Very lively and busy on St. Patrick‚Äôs Day weekend! The staff was attentive and took our order right away, but unfortunately the food left much to desire. I ordered the bacon and cabbage and it was unusually tasteless and bland. I was very underwhelmed and didn‚Äôt even finish half of it. My husband ordered the fish and chips, which should‚Äôve been a safe bet, you would think. The fish portion was huge, which was exciting at first, however, when we started eating the giant fish fillet, we found the batter was mushy inside and ruined the entire dish, sadly. We had a couple of Guinness beers and enjoyed the atmosphere, but less disappointed with the food."
"The Thomond Bar",349,"ben fairfield",326,"5 months ago",5,"Best food I‚Äôve had after 10 days in Ireland. Recommend cottage pie for sure.
Good atmosphere and portions. Beer pricey but it is everywhere."
"The Thomond Bar",349,"LullahPie",1581,"3 months ago",5,"Really nice place ! We had a breakfast for dinner, we were just a bit sad that we weren't seated with the rest of the bar, but it was nice ! Cheap option, it was the small breakfast too but it was more than enough !"
"The Thomond Bar",349,"Herwin",1049,"2 months ago",5,"Superb bar with a big terasse and a good atmosphere.
I can definitively recommend the irish breakfast if you're starting your day or the afternoon."
"The Thomond Bar",349,"Amanda Widick",165,"a month ago",5,"We got the full Irish breakfast and the Irish beef & Guinness stew and oh my goddess I have never had a more flavorful and filling stew in my life! The food is incredible, the service is outstanding; and the vibes feel like you‚Äôre a local. Highly recommend!"
"The Thomond Bar",349,"Mary Alice Miller",1684,"7 months ago",5,"Great live music. Friendly service. Plenty of seating, TVs, etc."
"Costa",350,"Jiaan Cui",1217,"a year ago",5,"Came to drink Costa with friends again, I still drink American, and she tried the cute new product! We talked for an afternoon, she wanted to be a flight attendant in the future, and I wanted to continue in the coffee industry. I hope we have a bright future ahead of us."
"Costa",350,"omkar kale",1948,"8 months ago",3,"Coffee is not that hot from the machine.
Steaming just removed the flavour.
Ambience is good for a date. No variety of sweets like bean n leaf. Available sweets are okay but feel a bit pricy for the the taste/quantity/quality"
"The Hi-B Bar",351,"Sally laret",2222,"6 days ago",5,"Absolutely loved this spot. The bartender, Juan, was not only incredibly skilled but also genuinely kind ‚Äî made us feel right at home. The small, intimate atmosphere added to the charm, and the bar‚Äôs unique no phone and ‚Äúplease‚Äù policy was a refreshing touch. It encouraged real conversation and a bit of old-school courtesy you don‚Äôt often see anymore. Can‚Äôt recommend it enough for anyone looking for a more thoughtful, personal experience in the city.
(Juan let me break the phone policy to take a photo. Not only did he say yes, but he joined us in the photo)
Came alway from Alaska for this experience! Would recommend!"
"The Hi-B Bar",351,"Jeff Love (Jeff Love)",1180,"2 months ago",5,"Take some time to be encouraged to put your cell phone away, then meet and talk to people. Bartenders here are fantastic.  I prefer the spot by the window or sitting at the bar."
"The Hi-B Bar",351,"Anna Mykhailova",225,"a month ago",5,"Amazing atmosphere, friendly staff and nice pints ! Good whisky and gin selection."
"The Hi-B Bar",351,"chefjj69",457,"a week ago",5,"I absolutely loved this bar.  Small, cozy and zero cell phones!  Great service from a super friendly and knowledgeable bartender.  Turned me onto some new whiskey choices.  Highly recommend!"
"The Hi-B Bar",351,"A J (Lexi)",14,"a month ago",5,"One of my favorites in Cork! We spent a day here and I tried to hit up as many places with Beamish that I could fit! We did Fri & Sat night. (Dont be a dork like me and take a pic inside...I had to get a pic though!) This very sweet older man was sitting next to me. He spoke about his younger years playing rugby and harvesting barley for Beamish. He was a pleasure to chat with. I came back the second night but was too late. He was leaving just as I arrived and the lone barwoman was overwhelmed.

Other favorites: The Raven was another quiet one, with nooks to disappear into. Thomond and Welcome Inn had the best music.

P.s. Chat with the older guys if you love Ireland. They'll tell you about a country you'll never get to witness. "" I'll remember you forever """
"The Hi-B Bar",351,"Dennis In Breda (deto69)",713,"3 weeks ago",5,"Such a lovely place. The ""don't use your phone"" works so well (as it should be). Everybody is happily chatting with each other"
"The Hi-B Bar",351,"Kevin Crowley",1415,"4 months ago",4,"Cosy little bar with great old school rules. No phones was always the main rule pushed by the previous owner and it really works a treat. Lovely atmosphere in here and ended up talking to couples sat around us just having a laugh. As it should be"
"The Hi-B Bar",351,"Barry Garceau",308,"5 months ago",5,"Been there twice.  Only had two trips to Cork, and Hi-B was a must-see according to my hosts.  I was not disappointed.  I've been to several Hibernian clubs here in the U.S., and so I felt ""at home"" here.  If ever I'm in Cork again, I will be sure to indulge in a pint or two, and join along with the singing that seems to spring from nowhere.  Fun place!"
"The Hi-B Bar",351,"Chris Johnson",477,"3 months ago",5,"Great place to get away from the busy outside shopping and enjoy a classic stout"
"The Hi-B Bar",351,"Puntie P",2072,"8 months ago",5,"Always a good spot when in cork. Pints are some of the best in cork city. Bar staff sound. No phones allowed. What more can ye ask for!"
